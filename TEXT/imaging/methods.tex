\section{Methods}
\label{imaging:methods}

This chapter provides the imaging and image analysis details
also
used for the experiments in \ar{insulation:introduction}.
The methods for cell culture, immunostaining,
and imaging are left to that chapter (see \ar{insulation:methods}).
Specific methodological details for the figures in
this chapter are primarily provided within the figure
legends; this section provides the remaining information.


\textbf{Cell culture.} I followed the methods in
\ar{insulation:methods}, with the following additions.
For \ar{fig:correction:samplenum}, I used a fluorescently-labeled
clone of the cell line A549 (ATCC \#CCL-185). This clone
contains a pSeg vector that co-expresses
Cyan Fluorescent Protein fused to
Drosophila Histone H2B to label nuclei and the
Red Fluorescent Protein variant mCherry to label the whole cell
(see Appendix \ar{pseg}). The clone was generated by
Jungseog Kang and Qi Wu (Altschuler \& Wu lab, UT Southwestern).


\textbf{Imaging.} Plates were imaged on one
of two Nikon Eclipse Ti-E2000 microscopes controlled by NIS
Elements version 4, using several optical setups. Image coordinates
were generated using NIS Elements or custom software for higher
precision. The cameras used were either a Roper Scientific CoolSnap
HQ2 CCD 14-bit \ar{fig:imaging:SBeffects} or an Andor Zyla sCMOS 11-bit.
