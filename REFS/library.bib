abstract = {We describe a cell-based kinetic profiling approach using impedance readout for monitoring the effect of small molecule compounds. This noninvasive readout allows continuous sampling of cellular responses to biologically active compounds and the ensuing kinetic profile provides information regarding the temporal interaction of compounds with cells. The utility of this approach was tested by screening a library containing FDA approved drugs, experimental compounds, and nature compounds. Compounds with similar activity produced similar impedance-based time-dependent cell response profiles (TCRPs). The compounds were clustered based on TCRP similarity. We identified novel mechanisms for existing drugs, confirmed previously reported calcium modulating activity for COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, and identified an additional mechanism for the experimental compound monastrol. We also identified and characterized a new antimitotic agent. Our findings indicate that the TCRP approach provides predictive mechanistic information for small molecule compounds.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Canonical Wnt signaling is thought to regulate cell behavior mainly by inducing $\beta$-catenin-dependent transcription of target genes. In proliferating cells Wnt signaling peaks in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but the significance of this “mitotic Wnt signaling” is unclear. Here we introduce Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which is independent of $\beta$-catenin and peaks during mitosis. We show that Wnt/STOP plays a critical role in protecting proteins, including c-MYC, from GSK3-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation. Wnt/STOP signaling increases cellular protein levels and cell size. Wnt/STOP, rather than $\beta$-catenin signaling, is the dominant mode of Wnt signaling in several cancer cell lines, where it is required for cell growth. We propose that Wnt/STOP signaling slows down protein degradation as cells prepare to divide.},

The LRP5/6 ectodomain contains four $\beta$-propeller/EGF-like domain repeats. The first two repeats, LRP6(1-2), bind to several Wnt variants, whereas LRP6(3-4) binds other Wnts. We present the crystal structure of the Dkk1 C-terminal domain bound to LRP6(3-4), and show that the Dkk1 N-terminal domain binds to LRP6(1-2), demonstrating that a single Dkk1 molecule can bind to both portions of the LRP6 ectodomain and thereby inhibit different Wnts. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of LRP6(1-4) bound to a noninhibitory antibody fragment or to full-length Dkk1 shows that in both cases the ectodomain adopts a curved conformation that places the first three repeats at a similar height relative to the membrane. Thus, Wnts bound to either portion of the LRP6 ectodomain likely bear a similar spatial relationship to Frizzled coreceptors.},

Here we demonstrate a novel link between transforming growth factor-$\beta$ and the canonical Wnt pathway. TGF-$\beta$ stimulates canonical Wnt signalling in a p38-dependent manner by decreasing the expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1. Tissue samples from human fibrotic diseases show enhanced expression of Wnt proteins and decreased expression of Dickkopf-1. Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway stimulates fibroblasts in vitro and induces fibrosis in vivo. Transgenic overexpression of Dickkopf-1 ameliorates skin fibrosis induced by constitutively active TGF-$\beta$ receptor type I signalling and also prevents fibrosis in other TGF-$\beta$-dependent animal models. These findings demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling is necessary for TGF-$\beta$-mediated fibrosis and highlight a key role for the interaction of both pathways in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases.},

However, the determinants and functional implications of EV are only beginning to be investigated. Our analyses based on multiple expression profiles in 41 primary human tissues show that a gene's EV is significantly correlated with a number of features pertaining to the genomic, epigenomic, regulatory, polymorphic, functional, structural and network characteristics of the gene. We found that (i) EV of a gene is encoded, in part, by its genomic context and is further influenced by the epigenome; (ii) strong promoters induce less variable expression; (iii) less variable gene loci evolve under purifying selection against copy number polymorphisms; (iv) genes that encode inherently disordered or highly interacting proteins exhibit lower variability; and (v) genes with less variable expression are enriched for house-keeping functions, while genes with highly variable expression tend to function in development and extra-cellular response and are associated with human diseases. Thus, our analysis reveals a number of potential mediators as well as functional and evolutionary correlates of EV, and provides new insights into the inherent variability in eukaryotic gene expression.},

However, the requirement for Wnts to spread has never been directly tested. Here we used genome engineering to replace the endogenous wingless gene, which encodes the main Drosophila Wnt, with one that expresses a membrane-tethered form of the protein. Surprisingly, the resulting flies were viable and produced normally patterned appendages of nearly the right size, albeit with a delay. We show that, in the prospective wing, prolonged wingless transcription followed by memory of earlier signalling allows persistent expression of relevant target genes. We suggest therefore that the spread of Wingless is dispensable for patterning and growth even though it probably contributes to increasing cell proliferation.},

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

In the pathophysiology of IBD, mesenchymal cells such as intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMF) affect the recruitment, retention and activation of immune cells. Mesenchymal cells also promote resolution of inflammatory activity accompanied with balanced repair processes. The transient appearance of mesenchymal cells is a feature of normal wound healing, but the persistence of these cells is associated with tissue fibrosis. Recent studies suggest that mesenchymal cells derived from bone marrow (BM) stem cells play a crucial role in intestinal repair and fibrosis. This article focuses on recent knowledge about ISEMF in the field of immune response inflammation and repair. Two major topics were documented: interaction between interleukin (IL)-17-secreting CD4+ cells (Th-17 cells) and about role of BM-derived stem cells in mucosal regenerative response via differentiation to ISEMF. Recent therapeutic strategies targeting BM stem cells for IBD patients were also documented.},

On the contrary, the TGF-beta-activated Smad3 triggers strikingly different programs such as mesodermal differentiation in early development. Because Smad1 and Smad3 contain identical amino acids at the DNA contact interface it is unclear how they elicit distinctive bioactivities. Here, we report the crystal structure of the MH1 domain of Smad1 bound to a palindromic Smad binding element. Surprisingly, the DNA contact interface of Smad1 is drastically rearranged when compared to Smad3. The N-terminal helix 1 of Smad1 is dislodged from its intramolecular binding site and adopts a domain swapped arrangement with a symmetry-related molecule. As a consequence, helix 2 kinks away from the double helix disabling several key phosphate backbone interactions. Thermal melting analysis corroborates a decompacted conformation of Smad1 and DNA binding assays indicate a lower overall affinity of Smad1 to DNA but increased cooperativity when binding to palindromic DNA motifs. These findings suggest that Smad1 and Smad3 evolved differential qualities to assemble on composite DNA elements and to engage in co-factor interactions by remodeling their N-termini.},

Such stochastic cell fate decisions generate nongenetic cellular diversity, which may be critical for metazoan development as well as optimized microbial resource utilization and survival in a fluctuating, frequently stressful environment. Here, we review several examples of cellular decision making from viruses, bacteria, yeast, lower metazoans, and mammals, highlighting the role of regulatory network structure and molecular noise. We propose that cellular decision making is one of at least three key processes underlying development at various scales of biological organization.},

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been implicated in several processes during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis. Maintenance of many organs such as skin, intestinal villi, bones and bone marrow requires continuous regeneration and subsequent differentiation of stem cells in order to maintain organ shape and size necessary for proper functioning. Although BMPs were initially identified as osteogenic factors present in demineralized bone capable of inducing ectopic bone formation, it is now evident that BMPs perform several other functions during embryonic development as well as during the adult life of an organism. Many disorders have been linked to either the BMPs or the molecules functioning downstream of BMP signaling pathway. This review summarizes the existing literature describing the role of BMP signaling during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis to provide a perspective on pharmacological interventions of BMP signaling pathway to mitigate several disease conditions.},

abstract = {Intestinal cancer is initiated by Wnt-pathway-activating mutations in genes such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). As in most cancers, the cell of origin has remained elusive. In a previously established Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5) knockin mouse model, a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase is expressed in long-lived intestinal stem cells. Here we show that deletion of Apc in these stem cells leads to their transformation within days. Transformed stem cells remain located at crypt bottoms, while fuelling a growing microadenoma. These microadenomas show unimpeded growth and develop into macroscopic adenomas within 3-5weeks. The distribution of Lgr5(+) cells within stem-cell-derived adenomas indicates that a stem cell/progenitor cell hierarchy is maintained in early neoplastic lesions. When Apc is deleted in short-lived transit-amplifying cells using a different cre mouse, the growth of the induced microadenomas rapidly stalls. Even after 30weeks, large adenomas are very rare in these mice. We conclude that stem-cell-specific loss of Apc results in progressively growing neoplasia.},

It is currently believed that four to six crypt stem cells reside at the +4 position immediately above the Paneth cells in the small intestine; colon stem cells remain undefined. Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5, also known as Gpr49) was selected from a panel of intestinal Wnt target genes for its restricted crypt expression. Here, using two knock-in alleles, we reveal exclusive expression of Lgr5 in cycling columnar cells at the crypt base. In addition, Lgr5 was expressed in rare cells in several other tissues. Using an inducible Cre knock-in allele and the Rosa26-lacZ reporter strain, lineage-tracing experiments were performed in adult mice. The Lgr5-positive crypt base columnar cell generated all epithelial lineages over a 60-day period, suggesting that it represents the stem cell of the small intestine and colon. The expression pattern of Lgr5 suggests that it marks stem cells in multiple adult tissues and cancers.},

abstract = {Cell surface receptors convert extracellular cues into receptor activation, thereby triggering intracellular signaling networks and controlling cellular decisions. A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools. These receptor properties enable the system to cope with basal and acute demand in the hematopoietic system.},

abstract = {Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.},

Endoglin is highly expressed in the tumor-associated vascular endothelium with prognostic significance in selected neoplasias and with potential to be a prime vascular target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy. On the other hand, the expression of endoglin and betaglycan in tumor cells themselves appears to play an important role in the progression of cancer, influencing cell proliferation, motility, invasiveness and tumorigenicity. In addition, experiments in vitro and in vivo in which endoglin or betaglycan expression is modulated have provided evidence that they act as tumor suppressors.

The effects of PDGF or FGF receptor signaling pathway on BMP2-induced osteoblastic differentiation was investigated in human MSC (HMSC). Inhibition of PDGF or/and FGF receptors enhanced BMP2-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, expression of Osterix, ALP and Bone sialoprotein, and matrix calcification. These effects were associated with increased Smad-1 activity, indicating that mitogenic factors interfere with Smad signaling in HMSC differentiation. RTK activate MAPK and inhibit GSK3 through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Biochemical analysis indicated that MAPK JNK and GSK3 especially are potential signaling molecules regulating BMP-induced osteoblastic HMSC differentiation. These observations highlight that the osteogenic effects of BMP2 are modulated by mitogenic factors acting through RTK.},

Large experimental and clinical data indicate that conventional anti-cancer therapies can not eradicate CSCs, and moreover, they usually increase their number leading to cancer recurrence and further drug resistance. In this review, several current controversies in the CSC field and recent studies, which help to shed light on their origin, are discussed. The emerging necessity for the development of complex, multimodal CSC-targeted treatment strategies, which combine conventional therapeutics with promising pathway-specific modulators, and natural compounds, which can improve the efficacy of conventional anti-cancer therapeutics and decrease their undesirable side effects is presented. Also, novel requirements and criteria necessary for evaluation of the CSC-targeted drug efficacy and relevant experimental models are discussed.},

Automated image analysis is required to identify interesting samples and extract quantitative information for high-content screening (HCS). However, researchers are impeded by the lack of metrics and software tools to identify image-based aberrations that pollute data, limiting experiment quality. The authors have developed and validated approaches to identify those image acquisition artifacts that prevent optimal extraction of knowledge from high-content microscopy experiments. They have implemented these as a versatile, open-source toolbox of algorithms and metrics readily usable by biologists to improve data quality in a wide variety of biological experiments.},

abstract = {Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are critical for pattern formation in many animals. In numerous tissues, BMPs become distributed in spatially non-uniform profiles. The gradients of signaling activity can be detected by a number of biological assays involving fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative analyses of BMP gradients are powerful tools to investigate the regulation of BMP signaling pathways during development. These approaches rely heavily on images as spatial representations of BMP activity levels, using them to infer signaling distributions that inform on regulatory mechanisms. In this perspective, we discuss current imaging assays and normalization methods used to quantify BMP activity profiles with a focus on the Drosophila wing primordium. We find that normalization tends to lower the number of samples required to establish statistical significance between profiles in controls and experiments, but the increased resolvability comes with a cost. Each normalization strategy makes implicit assumptions about the biology that impacts our interpretation of the data. We examine the tradeoffs for normalizing versus not normalizing, and discuss their impacts on experimental design and the interpretation of resultant data.},

Integrating the molecular, cellular and tissue level of description, this model links a broad spectrum of experimental observations encompassing spatially confined cell proliferation, directed cell migration, multiple cell lineage decisions and clonal competition.Using computational simulations we demonstrate that the model is capable of quantitatively describing and predicting the dynamic behaviour of the intestinal tissue during steady state as well as after cell damage and following selective gain or loss of gene function manipulations affecting Wnt- and Notch-signalling. Our simulation results suggest that reversibility and flexibility of cellular decisions are key elements of robust tissue organisation of the intestine. We predict that the tissue should be able to fully recover after complete elimination of cellular subpopulations including subpopulations deemed to be functional stem cells. This challenges current views of tissue stem cell organisation.},

abstract = {The application of high-content imaging in conjunction with multivariate clustering techniques has recently shown value in the confirmation of cellular activity and further characterization of drug mode of action following pharmacologic perturbation. However, such practical examples of phenotypic profiling of drug response published to date have largely been restricted to cell lines and phenotypic response markers that are amenable to basic cellular imaging. As such, these approaches preclude the analysis of both complex heterogeneous phenotypic responses and subtle changes in cell morphology across physiologically relevant cell panels. Here, we describe the application of a cell-based assay and custom designed image analysis algorithms designed to monitor morphologic phenotypic response in detail across distinct cancer cell types. We further describe the integration of these methods with automated data analysis workflows incorporating principal component analysis, Kohonen neural networking, and kNN classification to enable rapid and robust interrogation of such data sets. We show the utility of these approaches by providing novel insight into pharmacologic response across four cancer cell types, Ovcar3, MiaPaCa2, and MCF7 cells wild-type and mutant for p53. These methods have the potential to drive the development of a new generation of novel therapeutic classes encompassing pharmacologic compositions or polypharmacology in appropriate disease context.},

@article{Candia1997,
abstract = {During early embryogenesis of Xenopus, dorsoventral polarity of the mesoderm is established by dorsalizing and ventralizing agents, which are presumably mediated by the activity of an activin/BVg1-like protein and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP), respectively. Interestingly, these two TGF-beta subfamilies are found in overlapping regions during mesoderm patterning. This raises the question of how the presumptive mesodermal cells recognize the multiple TGF-beta signals and differentially interpret this information to assign a particular cell fate. In this study, we have exploited the well characterized model of Xenopus mesoderm induction to determine the intracellular interactions between BMP-2/4 and activin/BVg1 signaling cascades. Using a constitutively active BMP-2/4 receptor that transduces BMP-2/4 signals in a ligand-independent fashion, we demonstrate that signals provided by activin/BVg1 and BMP modulate each other's activity and that this crosstalk occurs through intracellular mechanisms. In assays using BMP-2/4 and activin/BVg1-specific reporters, we determined that the specificity of BMP-2/4 and activin/BVg1 signaling is mediated by Smad1 and Smad2, respectively. These Smads should be considered as the mediators of the intracellular antagonism between BMP-2/4 and activin/BVg1 signaling possibly through sequestration of a limited pool of Smad4. Consistent with such a mechanism, Smad4 interacts functionally with both Smad1 and -2 to potentiate their signaling activities, and a dominant negative variant of Smad4 can inhibit both activin/BVg1 and BMP-2/4 mediated signaling Finally, we demonstrate that an activin/BVg1-dependent transcriptional complex contains both Smad2 and Smad4 and thereby provides a physical basis for the functional involvement of both Smads in TGF-beta-dependent transcriptional regulation. Thus, Smad4 plays a central role in synergistically activating activin/BVg1 and BMP-dependent transcription and functions as an intracellular sensor for TGF-beta-related signals.},

Data are usually obtained by measurements on samples in microwell plates and are often subjected to artefacts that can bias the result selection. We report here a novel edge effect correction algorithm suitable for RNA interference (RNAi) screening, because its normalization does not rely on the entire dataset and takes into account the specificities of such a screening process. The proposed method is able to estimate the edge effects for each assay plate individually using the data from a single control column based on diffusion model, and thus targeting a specific but recurrent well-known HTS artefact. This method was first developed and validated using control plates and was then applied to the correction of experimental data generated during a genome-wide siRNA screen aimed at studying HIV-host interactions. The proposed algorithm was able to correct the edge effect biasing the control data and thus improve assay quality and, consequently, the hit-selection step.},

abstract = {Integration of retroviral vectors in the human genome follows nonrandom patterns that favor insertional deregulation of gene expression and increase the risk of their use in clinical gene therapy. The molecular basis of retroviral target site selection is still poorly understood. We used deep sequencing technology to build genomewide, high-definition maps of > 60 000 integration sites of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)- and HIV-based retroviral vectors in the genome of human CD34(+) multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and used gene expression profiling, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics to associate integration to genetic and epigenetic features of the HPC genome. Clusters of recurrent MLV integrations identify regulatory elements (alternative promoters, enhancers, evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions) within or around protein-coding genes and microRNAs with crucial functions in HPC growth and differentiation, bearing epigenetic marks of active or poised transcription (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, Pol II) and specialized chromatin configurations (H2A.Z). Overall, we mapped 3500 high-frequency integration clusters, which represent a new resource for the identification of transcriptionally active regulatory elements. High-definition MLV integration maps provide a rational basis for predicting genotoxic risks in gene therapy and a new tool for genomewide identification of promoters and regulatory elements controlling hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions.},

After preclinical studies, a gene therapy trial for SCID-X1 was initiated, based on the use of complementary DNA containing a defective gammac Moloney retrovirus-derived vector and ex vivo infection of CD34+ cells. After a 10-month follow-up period, gammac transgene-expressing T and NK cells were detected in two patients. T, B, and NK cell counts and function, including antigen-specific responses, were comparable to those of age-matched controls. Thus, gene therapy was able to provide full correction of disease phenotype and, hence, clinical benefit.},

abstract = {Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway is often dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activated $\beta$-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and nucleus and forms a nuclear complex with TCF/LEF factors like TCF4. Interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN-$\alpha$) has recently been recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in prevention and treatment of HCC. Transforming Growth Factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) is a mediator of apoptosis, exerting its effects via Smads proteins. One mode of interaction between Wnt/$\beta$-catenin and TGF-$\beta$1/Smads pathways is the association of Smads with $\beta$-catenin/TCF4. In this study we analyzed the effects of IFN-$\alpha$2b and TGF-$\beta$1 treatments on Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway, Smads proteins levels, $\beta$-catenin/TCF4/Smads interaction and proliferation and apoptotic death in HepG2/C3A and Huh7 cell lines. IFN-$\alpha$2b and TGF-$\beta$1 attenuated Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signal by decreasing $\beta$-catenin and Frizzled7 receptor proteins contents and the interaction of $\beta$-catenin with TCF4. Truncated $\beta$-catenin form present in C3A cell line also diminished after treatments. Both cytokines declined Smads proteins and their interaction with TCF4. The overall cellular response to cytokines was the decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptotic death. Treatment with Wnt3a, which elevates $\beta$-catenin protein levels, also generated the increment of Smads proteins contents when comparing with untreated cells. In conclusion, IFN-$\alpha$2b and TGF-$\beta$1 proved to be effective as modulators of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway in HCC cell lines holding both wild-type and truncated $\beta$-catenin. Since the inhibition of $\beta$-catenin/TCF4/Smads complexes formation may have a critical role in slowing down oncogenesis, IFN-$\alpha$2b and TGF-$\beta$1 could be useful as potential treatments in patients with HCC.},

abstract = {The formation of protein complexes between phosphorylated R-Smads and Smad4 is a central event in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. We have determined the crystal structure of two R-Smad/Smad4 complexes, Smad3/Smad4 to 2.5 angstroms, and Smad2/Smad4 to 2.7 angstroms. Both complexes are heterotrimers, comprising two phosphorylated R-Smad subunits and one Smad4 subunit, a finding that was corroborated by isothermal titration calorimetry and mutational studies. Preferential formation of the R-Smad/Smad4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. The study supports a common mechanism of Smad protein assembly in TGF-beta superfamily signaling.},

abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of 'gene expression noise', or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants. Such 'non-genetic cell individuality' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous 'outlier' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a >200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a >15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

abstract = {Despite explosive growth in genomic datasets, the methods for studying epigenomic mechanisms of gene regulation remain primitive. Here we present a model-based approach to systematically analyze the epigenomic functions in modulating transcription factor-DNA binding. Based on the first principles of statistical mechanics, this model considers the interactions between epigenomic modifications and a cis-regulatory module, which contains multiple binding sites arranged in any configurations. We compiled a comprehensive epigenomic dataset in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, including DNA methylation (MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq), DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC-seq), and histone modifications (ChIP-seq). We discovered correlations of transcription factors (TFs) for specific combinations of epigenomic modifications, which we term epigenomic motifs. Epigenomic motifs explained why some TFs appeared to have different DNA binding motifs derived from in vivo (ChIP-seq) and in vitro experiments. Theoretical analyses suggested that the epigenome can modulate transcriptional noise and boost the cooperativity of weak TF binding sites. ChIP-seq data suggested that epigenomic boost of binding affinities in weak TF binding sites can function in mES cells. We showed in theory that the epigenome should suppress the TF binding differences on SNP-containing binding sites in two people. Using personal data, we identified strong associations between H3K4me2/H3K9ac and the degree of personal differences in NF$\kappa$B binding in SNP-containing binding sites, which may explain why some SNPs introduce much smaller personal variations on TF binding than other SNPs. In summary, this model presents a powerful approach to analyze the functions of epigenomic modifications. This model was implemented into an open source program APEG (Affinity Prediction by Epigenome and Genome, http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/apeg).},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\beta$)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is involved in a vast majority of cellular processes and is fundamentally important throughout life. TGF-$\beta$/BMPs have widely recognized roles in bone formation during mammalian development and exhibit versatile regulatory functions in the body. Signaling transduction by TGF-$\beta$/BMPs is specifically through both canonical Smad-dependent pathways (TGF-$\beta$/BMP ligands, receptors and Smads) and non-canonical Smad-independent signaling pathway (e.g. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, MAPK). Following TGF-$\beta$/BMP induction, both the Smad and p38 MAPK pathways converge at the Runx2 gene to control mesenchymal precursor cell differentiation. The coordinated activity of Runx2 and TGF-$\beta$/BMP-activated Smads is critical for formation of the skeleton. Recent advances in molecular and genetic studies using gene targeting in mice enable a better understanding of TGF-$\beta$/BMP signaling in bone and in the signaling networks underlying osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of TGF-$\beta$/BMP signaling in bone from studies of genetic mouse models and human diseases caused by the disruption of TGF-$\beta$/BMP signaling. This review also highlights the different modes of cross-talk between TGF-$\beta$/BMP signaling and the signaling pathways of MAPK, Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and FGF in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.},

abstract = {Growth factors activate Ras, PI3K, and other signaling pathways. It is not well understood how these signals are translated by individual cells into a decision to proliferate or differentiate. Here, using single-cell image analysis of nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated PC12 cells, we identified a two-dimensional phospho-ERK (pERK)-phospho-AKT (pAKT) response map with a curved boundary that separates differentiating from proliferating cells. The boundary position remained invariant when different stimuli were used or upstream signaling components perturbed. We further identified Rasa2 as a negative feedback regulator that links PI3K to Ras, placing the stochastically distributed pERK-pAKT signals close to the decision boundary. This allows for uniform NGF stimuli to create a subpopulation of cells that differentiates with each cycle of proliferation. Thus, by linking a complex signaling system to a simpler intermediate response map, cells gain unique integration and control capabilities to balance cell number expansion with differentiation.},

The LRP6 ectodomain comprises four tandem $\beta$-propeller-EGF-like domain (PE) pairs that harbor binding sites for Wnt morphogens and their antagonists including Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1). To understand how these multiple interactions are integrated, we combined crystallographic analysis of the third and fourth PE pairs with electron microscopy (EM) to determine the complete ectodomain structure. An extensive inter-pair interface, conserved for the first-to-second and third-to-fourth PE interactions, contributes to a compact platform-like architecture, which is disrupted by mutations implicated in developmental diseases. EM reconstruction of the LRP6 platform bound to chaperone Mesd exemplifies a binding mode spanning PE pairs. Cellular and binding assays identify overlapping Wnt3a- and Dkk1-binding surfaces on the third PE pair, consistent with steric competition, but also suggest a model in which the platform structure supports an interplay of ligands through multiple interaction sites.},

We developed an integrative theoretical and experimental framework, based on the formalism of information theory, to quantitatively predict and measure the amount of information transduced by molecular and cellular networks. Analyzing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling revealed that individual TNF signaling pathways transduce information sufficient for accurate binary decisions, and an upstream bottleneck limits the information gained via multiple integrated pathways. Negative feedback to this bottleneck could both alleviate and enhance its limiting effect, despite decreasing noise.

Consequently much effort is directed at trying to block the damaging effects of TGFbeta in the lens. To do this effectively it is important to know the key signaling pathways regulated by TGFbeta that lead to EMT and PCO. Given that Wnt signaling is involved in TGFbeta-induced EMT in other systems, this study set out to determine if Wnt signaling has a role in regulating this process in the lens. Using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunolocalization this study clearly shows that Wnts 5a, 5b, 7b, 8a, 8b and their Frizzled receptors are upregulated in association with TGFbeta-induced EMT and cataract development. Both rat in vitro and mouse in vivo cataract models show similar profiles for the Wnt and Frizzled mRNAs and proteins that were assessed. Currently it is not clear if the canonical beta-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, or a non-canonical pathway, is activated in this context. Overall, the results from the current study indicate that Wnt signaling is involved in TGFbeta-induced EMT and development of fibrotic plaques in the lens.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling is an important regulator of cellular growth and differentiation. The principal intracellular mediators of TGFbeta signalling are the Smad proteins, which upon TGFbeta stimulation accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed a simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built using both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad concentrations (isoforms 2, 3 and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells that Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)) was present in similar amounts to Smad4 (9.3-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)), whereas both were in excess of Smad3 (1.1-2.0 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)). Variation of the model parameters and statistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to parameters affecting the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and Smad complex formation/ dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the model revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an important mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed that binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently mediate Smad nuclear accumulation, if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore conclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation during TGFbeta signalling.},

abstract = {Biomolecular interactions are fundamental to the vast majority of cellular processes, and identification of the major interacting components is usually the first step toward an understanding of the mechanisms that govern various cell functions. Thus, statistical image analyses that can be performed on fluorescence microscopy images of fixed or live cells have been routinely applied for biophysical and cell biological studies. These approaches measure the fraction of interacting particles by analyzing dual color fluorescence images for colocalized pixels. Colocalization algorithms have proven to be effective, although the dynamic range and accuracy of these measurements has never been well established. Spatial image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS), which cross-correlates spatial intensity fluctuations recorded in images from two detection channels simultaneously, has also recently been shown to be an effective measure of colocalization as well. Through simulations, imaging of fluorescent antibodies adsorbed on glass and cell measurements, we show that ICCS performs much better than standard colocalization algorithms at moderate to high densities of particles, which are often encountered in cellular systems. Furthermore, it was found that the density ratio between the two labeled species of interest plays a major role in the accuracy of the colocalization analysis. By applying a direct and systematic comparison between the standard, fluorescence microscopy colocalization algorithm and spatial ICCS, we show regimes where each approach is applicable, and more importantly, where they fail to yield accurate results.},

abstract = {Natural variability in the abundance of signaling regulators can lead to divergence in cell fate, even within genetically identical cells that share a common differentiation state. We introduce cell-to-cell variability analysis (CCVA), an experimental and computational methodology that quantifies the correlation between variability in signaling regulator abundance and variation in the sensitivity of cells to stimuli. With CCVA, we investigated the unexpected effects of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor $\alpha$ chain (IL-2R$\alpha$) on the sensitivity of primary mouse T lymphocytes to cytokines that signal through receptors that have the common $\gamma$ chain ($\gamma$(c)). Our work showed that increased IL-2R$\alpha$ abundance decreased the concentration of IL-2 required for a half-maximal activation (EC(50)) of the downstream effector signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), but reduced the responsiveness to IL-7 or IL-15, without affecting the EC(50) values of other $\gamma$(c) cytokines. To investigate the mechanism of the effect of IL-2R$\alpha$ on $\gamma$(c) cytokine signaling, we introduced a Bayesian-inference computational framework that models the formation of receptor signaling complexes with data from previous biophysical measurements. With this framework, we found that a model in which IL-2R$\alpha$ drives $\gamma$(c) depletion through the assembly of functional IL-2R complexes was consistent with both the CCVA data and experimental measurements. The combination of CCVA and computational modeling produced quantitative understanding of the crosstalk between $\gamma$(c) cytokine receptor signaling in T lymphocytes.},

Here we implement single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis to dissect the cellular composition of primary human normal colon and colon cancer epithelia. We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 versus CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signals predominantly through a receptor complex comprising ALK5 and TbetaRII to activate receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) Smad2 and Smad3. In endothelial cells, however, TGF-beta can additionally activate Smad1 and Smad5. Here, we report that TGF-beta also strongly induces phosphorylation of Smad1/5 in many different normal epithelial cells, epithelium-derived tumor cells, and fibroblasts. We demonstrate that TbetaRII and ALK5, as well as ALK2 and/or ALK3, are required for TGF-beta-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation. We show that the simultaneous activation of the R-Smads Smad2/3 and Smad1/5 by TGF-beta results in the formation of mixed R-Smad complexes, containing, for example, phosphorylated Smad1 and Smad2. The prevalence of these mixed R-Smad complexes explains why TGF-beta-induced Smad1/5 phosphorylation does not result in transcriptional activation via bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-responsive elements, which bind activated Smad1/5-Smad4 complexes that are induced by BMP stimulation. Thus, TGF-beta induces two parallel pathways: one signaling via Smad2-Smad4 or Smad3-Smad4 complexes and the other signaling via mixed R-Smad complexes. Finally, we assess the function of the novel arm of TGF-beta signaling and show that TGF-beta-induced Smad1/5 activation is not required for the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta but is specifically required for TGF-beta-induced anchorage-independent growth.},

A crystal structure of a member of this family, TGF-beta 2, has been determined at 2.1 angstrom (A) resolution and refined to an R factor of 0.172. The monomer lacks a well-defined hydrophobic core and displays an unusual elongated nonglobular fold with dimensions of approximately 60 A by 20 A by 15 A. Eight cysteines form four intrachain disulfide bonds, which are clustered in a core region forming a network complementary to the network of hydrogen bonds. The dimer is stabilized by the ninth cysteine, which forms an interchain disulfide bond, and by two identical hydrophobic interfaces. Sequence profile analysis of other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including the activins, inhibins, and several developmental factors, imply that they also adopt the TGF-beta fold.},

abstract = {The adult stem cell marker Lgr5 and its relative Lgr4 are often co-expressed in Wnt-driven proliferative compartments. We find that conditional deletion of both genes in the mouse gut impairs Wnt target gene expression and results in the rapid demise of intestinal crypts, thus phenocopying Wnt pathway inhibition. Mass spectrometry demonstrates that Lgr4 and Lgr5 associate with the Frizzled/Lrp Wnt receptor complex. Each of the four R-spondins, secreted Wnt pathway agonists, can bind to Lgr4, -5 and -6. In HEK293 cells, RSPO1 enhances canonical WNT signals initiated by WNT3A. Removal of LGR4 does not affect WNT3A signalling, but abrogates the RSPO1-mediated signal enhancement, a phenomenon rescued by re-expression of LGR4, -5 or -6. Genetic deletion of Lgr4/5 in mouse intestinal crypt cultures phenocopies withdrawal of Rspo1 and can be rescued by Wnt pathway activation. Lgr5 homologues are facultative Wnt receptor components that mediate Wnt signal enhancement by soluble R-spondin proteins. These results will guide future studies towards the application of R-spondins for regenerative purposes of tissues expressing Lgr5 homologues.},

The organ is composed of all three germ layers signaling to each other during development to form the adult structure. The gut epithelium is a constitutively developing tissue, constantly differentiating from a stem cell in a progenitor pool throughout the life of the organism. Signals from the adjacent mesoderm and between epithelial cells are required for normal orderly development/differentiation, homeostasis, and apoptosis. Embryonically important patterning factors are used during adult stages for these processes. Such critical pathways as the hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein, Notch, Sox, and Wnt systems are used both in embryologic and adult times of gut development. We focus on and review the roles of these factors in gut epithelial cell development and differentiation.},

abstract = {While the adult murine lung utilizes multiple compartmentally restricted progenitor cells during homeostasis and repair, much less is known about the progenitor cells from the human lung. Translating the murine stem cell model to humans is hindered by anatomical differences between species. Here we show that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) display characteristics of multipotent stem cells of the lung. These HBECs express markers indicative of several epithelial types of the adult lung when experimentally tested in cell culture. When cultured in three different three-dimensional (3D) systems, subtle changes in the microenvironment result in unique responses including the ability of HBECs to differentiate into multiple central and peripheral lung cell types. These new findings indicate that the adult human lung contains a multipotent progenitor cell whose differentiation potential is primarily dictated by the microenvironment. The HBEC system is not only important in understanding mechanisms for specific cell lineage differentiation, but also for examining changes that correlate with human lung diseases including lung cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The c-Myc oncoprotein is activated in the majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs), whereas the TGF-$\beta$ pathway is frequently affected by loss-of-function mutations, for example in SMAD2/3/4 genes. The canonical model places Myc downstream of inhibitory TGF-$\beta$ signaling. However, we previously demonstrated that Myc also inhibits TGF-$\beta$ signaling through the miR-17\~{}92 microRNA cluster, raising the question about functional relationships between these two pathways.

METHODS: We engineered a series of genetically complex murine and human CRC cell lines in which Myc and TGF-$\beta$ activities could be manipulated simultaneously. This was achieved through retroviral expression of the Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein and through Smad4 short hairpin RNA knockdown. Cell lines thus modified were injected subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice, and the resultant tumors (n = 5-10 per treatment group) were analyzed for overall growth and neovascularization. Additionally, the distribution of MYC and TGF-$\beta$ pathway mutations was analyzed in previously profiled human CRC samples.

RESULTS: In kras-mutated/trp53-deleted murine colonocytes, either Myc activation or TGF-$\beta$ inactivation increased tumor sizes and microvascular densities approximately 1.5- to 2.5-fold, chiefly through downregulation of thrombospondin-1 and related type I repeat-containing proteins. Combining Myc activation with TGF-$\beta$ inactivation did not further accelerate tumorigenesis. This redundancy and the negative effect of TGF-$\beta$ signaling on angiogenesis were also demonstrated using xenografts of human CRC cell lines. Furthermore, the analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed that in CRC without microsatellite instability, overexpression of Myc and inactivation of Smads (including acquired mutations in SMAD2) are mutually exclusive, with odds ratio less than 0.1.

CONCLUSIONS: In human CRC, gain-of-function alterations in Myc and loss-of-function alterations in TGF-$\beta$ exhibit a masking epistatic interaction and are functionally redundant.},

However, extensive fractionation comes at the expense of sample losses, hampering the analysis of limited material. We previously described a highly sensitive multidimensional chromatographic strategy based on a combination of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and reversed phase chromatography, which allows proteomic analysis with minimal sample losses. Here we apply this strategy to the analysis of a limited number of FACS-sorted colon stem cells extracted from mouse intestine, obtaining a proteome coverage comparable to current methods that generally require 100-fold more starting material. We propose that this alternative multidimensional chromatographic technology will find ample application such as in the analysis of distinct cellular populations obtained by laser microdissection.},

abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability in protein concentration. However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) initiates its diverse cellular responses by binding to and activating specific cell surface receptors that have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity. These activated TGF-$\beta$ receptors stimulate the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad proteins, which in turn form complexes with Smad4 that accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. TGF-$\beta$ responses can be cell-type specific and are dependent on both the concentration of TGF-$\beta$ signalling components and the activity of other signal transduction pathways, which can either synergize with or antagonize the TGF-$\beta$ pathway. Recent research has provided insights into the specificity determinants of TGF-$\beta$–Smad signalling, including combinatorial ligand–receptor associations, selective interactions between the Smads and other pathway components that are mediated through defined binding motifs, and the differential regulation of duration and intensity of signalling.},

abstract = {The histone code hypothesis holds that covalent posttranslational modifications of histone tails are interpreted by the cell to yield a rich combinatorial transcriptional output. This hypothesis has been the subject of active debate in the literature. Here, we investigated the combinatorial complexity of the acetylation code at the four lysine residues of the histone H4 tail in budding yeast. We constructed yeast strains carrying all 15 possible combinations of mutations among lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 to arginine in the histone H4 tail, mimicking positively charged, unacetylated lysine states, and characterized the resulting genome-wide changes in gene expression by using DNA microarrays. Only the lysine 16 mutation had specific transcriptional consequences independent of the mutational state of the other lysines (affecting approximately 100 genes). In contrast, for lysines 5, 8, and 12, expression changes were due to nonspecific, cumulative effects seen as increased transcription correlating with an increase in the total number of mutations (affecting approximately 1,200 genes). Thus, acetylation of histone H4 is interpreted by two mechanisms: a specific mechanism for lysine 16 and a nonspecific, cumulative mechanism for lysines 5, 8, and 12.},

Because of their solid basis in statistics, allowing to deal with the stochastic aspects of gene expressions and noisy measurements in a natural way, Bayesian networks appear attractive in the field of inferring gene interactions structure from microarray experiments data. However, the basic formalism has some disadvantages, e.g. it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the origin and the target of an interaction. Two kinds of microarray experiments yield data particularly rich in information regarding the direction of interactions: time series and perturbation experiments. In order to correctly handle them, the basic formalism must be modified. For example, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) apply to time series microarray data. To our knowledge the DBN technique has not been applied in the context of perturbation experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput screening (HTS) is a key part of the drug discovery process during which thousands of chemical compounds are screened and their activity levels measured in order to identify potential drug candidates (i.e., hits). Many technical, procedural or environmental factors can cause systematic measurement error or inequalities in the conditions in which the measurements are taken. Such systematic error has the potential to critically affect the hit selection process. Several error correction methods and software have been developed to address this issue in the context of experimental HTS 1234567. Despite their power to reduce the impact of systematic error when applied to error perturbed datasets, those methods also have one disadvantage - they introduce a bias when applied to data not containing any systematic error 6. Hence, we need first to assess the presence of systematic error in a given HTS assay and then carry out systematic error correction method if and only if the presence of systematic error has been confirmed by statistical tests.

RESULTS: We tested three statistical procedures to assess the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS data, including the $\chi$2 goodness-of-fit test, Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 8 preceded by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method 9. We applied these procedures to raw HTS measurements, first, and to estimated hit distribution surfaces, second. The three competing tests were applied to analyse simulated datasets containing different types of systematic error, and to a real HTS dataset. Their accuracy was compared under various error conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: A successful assessment of the presence of systematic error in experimental HTS assays is possible when the appropriate statistical methodology is used. Namely, the t-test should be carried out by researchers to determine whether systematic error is present in their HTS data prior to applying any error correction method. This important step can significantly improve the quality of selected hits.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Rapid advances in biomedical sciences and genetics have increased the pressure on drug development companies to promptly translate new knowledge into treatments for disease. Impelled by the demand and facilitated by technological progress, the number of compounds evaluated during the initial high-throughput screening (HTS) step of drug discovery process has steadily increased. As a highly automated large-scale process, HTS is prone to systematic error caused by various technological and environmental factors. A number of error correction methods have been designed to reduce the effect of systematic error in experimental HTS (Brideau et al., 2003; Carralot et al., 2012; Kevorkov and Makarenkov, 2005; Makarenkov et al., 2007; Malo et al., 2010). Despite their power to correct systematic error when it is present, the applicability of those methods in practice is limited by the fact that they can potentially introduce a bias when applied to unbiased data. We describe two new methods for eliminating systematic error from HTS data based on a prior knowledge of the error location. This information can be obtained using a specific version of the t-test or of the $\chi$(2) goodness-of-fit test as discussed in Dragiev et al. (2011). We will show that both new methods constitute an important improvement over the standard practice of not correcting for systematic error at all as well as over the B-score correction procedure (Brideau et al., 2003) which is widely used in the modern HTS. We will also suggest a more general data preprocessing framework where the new methods can be applied in combination with the Well Correction procedure (Makarenkov et al., 2007). Such a framework will allow for removing systematic biases affecting all plates of a given screen as well as those relative to some of its individual plates.},

In many systems, the only viable way to measure protein levels is by immunofluorescence, which is notorious for its limited accuracy. Using the early Drosophila embryo as an example, we show that careful identification and control of experimental error allows for highly accurate gene expression measurements. We generated antibodies in different host species, allowing for simultaneous staining of four Drosophila gap genes in individual embryos. Careful error analysis of hundreds of expression profiles reveals that less than ∼20\% of the observed embryo-to-embryo fluctuations stem from experimental error. These measurements make it possible to extract not only very accurate mean gene expression profiles but also their naturally occurring fluctuations of biological origin and corresponding cross-correlations. We use this analysis to extract gap gene profile dynamics with ∼1 min accuracy. The combination of these new measurements and analysis techniques reveals a twofold increase in profile reproducibility owing to a collective network dynamics that relays positional accuracy from the maternal gradients to the pair-rule genes.},

abstract = {Cells in a developing embryo have no direct way of "measuring" their physical position. Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of \~{}1 along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

abstract = {Cells remove proteins by two processes: degradation and dilution due to cell growth. The balance between these basic processes is poorly understood. We addressed this by developing an accurate and noninvasive method for measuring protein half-lives, called "bleach-chase," that is applicable to fluorescently tagged proteins. Assaying 100 proteins in living human cancer cells showed half-lives that ranged between 45 minutes and 22.5 hours. A variety of stresses that stop cell division showed the same general effect: Long-lived proteins became longer-lived, whereas short-lived proteins remained largely unaffected. This effect is due to the relative strengths of degradation and dilution and suggests a mechanism for differential killing of rapidly growing cells by growth-arresting drugs. This approach opens a way to understand proteome half-life dynamics in living cells.},

abstract = {For an epithelium to provide a protective barrier, it must maintain homeostatic cell numbers by matching the number of dividing cells with the number of dying cells. Although compensatory cell division can be triggered by dying cells, it is unknown how cell death might relieve overcrowding due to proliferation. When we trigger apoptosis in epithelia, dying cells are extruded to preserve a functional barrier. Extrusion occurs by cells destined to die signalling to surrounding epithelial cells to contract an actomyosin ring that squeezes the dying cell out. However, it is not clear what drives cell death during normal homeostasis. Here we show in human, canine and zebrafish cells that overcrowding due to proliferation and migration induces extrusion of live cells to control epithelial cell numbers. Extrusion of live cells occurs at sites where the highest crowding occurs in vivo and can be induced by experimentally overcrowding monolayers in vitro. Like apoptotic cell extrusion, live cell extrusion resulting from overcrowding also requires sphingosine 1-phosphate signalling and Rho-kinase-dependent myosin contraction, but is distinguished by signalling through stretch-activated channels. Moreover, disruption of a stretch-activated channel, Piezo1, in zebrafish prevents extrusion and leads to the formation of epithelial cell masses. Our findings reveal that during homeostatic turnover, growth and division of epithelial cells on a confined substratum cause overcrowding that leads to their extrusion and consequent death owing to the loss of survival factors. These results suggest that live cell extrusion could be a tumour-suppressive mechanism that prevents the accumulation of excess epithelial cells.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {Although regulation of stem cell homeostasis by microRNAs (miRNAs) is well studied, it is unclear how individual miRNAs genomically encoded within an organized polycistron can interact to induce an integrated phenotype. miR-99a/100, let-7, and miR-125b paralogs are encoded in two tricistrons on human chromosomes 11 and 21. They are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), an aggressive form of leukemia with poor prognosis. Here, we show that miR-99a/100∼125b tricistrons are transcribed as a polycistronic message transactivated by the homeobox transcription factor HOXA10. Integrative analysis of global gene expression profiling, miRNA target prediction, and pathway architecture revealed that miR-99a/100, let-7, and miR-125b functionally converge at the combinatorial block of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) pathway by targeting four receptor subunits and two SMAD signaling transducers. In addition, down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/APC2 stabilizes active $\beta$-catenin and enhances Wnt signaling. By switching the balance between Wnt and TGF$\beta$ signaling, the concerted action of these tricistronic miRNAs promoted sustained expansion of murine and human HSCs in vitro or in vivo while favoring megakaryocytic differentiation. Hence, our study explains the high phylogenetic conservation of the miR-99a/100∼125b tricistrons controlling stem cell homeostasis, the deregulation of which contributes to the development of AMKL.},

abstract = {Landmark cancer genome resequencing efforts are leading to the identification of mutated genes in many types of cancer. The extreme diversity of mutations being detected presents significant challenges to subdivide causal from coincidental mutations in order to elucidate how disrupted regulatory networks drive cancer processes. Given that a common early perturbation in solid tumor initiation is bypass of matrix-dependent proliferation restraints we sought to functionally interrogate candidate colorectal cancer genes (CAN-genes) to identify driver tumor-suppressors. We have employed an isogenic human colonic epithelial cell (HCEC) model to identify suppressors of anchorage-independent growth by conducting a soft agar based shRNA screen within the cohort of CAN-genes. Remarkably, depletion of 65 of the 151 CAN-genes tested collaborated with ectopic expression of K-RASV12 and/or TP53 knockdown to promote anchorage-independent proliferation of HCECs. In contrast only 5 out of 362 random shRNAs (1.4\%) enhanced soft agar growth. We have identified additional members of an extensive gene network specifying matrix-dependent proliferation, by constructing an interaction map of these confirmed progression suppressors with the \~{}700 mutated genes that were excluded from CAN-genes, and experimentally verifying soft-agar growth enhancement in response to depletion of some of these genes. Collectively, this study revealed profound diversity of nodes within a fundamental tumor suppressor network that are susceptible to perturbation leading to enhanced cell-autonomous anchorage-independent proliferative fitness. Tumor suppressor network fragility as a paradigm within this and other regulatory systems perturbed in cancer, could in large part, account for the heterogeneity of somatic mutations detected in tumors.},

abstract = {OLs (oligodendrocytes) are the myelinating cells of the CNS (central nervous system), wrapping axons in conductive sheathes to ensure effective transmission of neural signals. The regulation of OL development, from precursor to mature myelinating cell, is controlled by a variety of inhibitory and inductive signalling factors. The dorsal spinal cord contains signals that inhibit OL development, possibly to prevent premature and ectopic precursor differentiation. The Wnt and BMP (bone morphogenic protein) signalling pathways have been identified as dorsal spinal cord signals with overlapping temporal activity, and both have similar inhibitory effects on OL differentiation. Both these pathways feature prominently in many developmental processes and demyelinating events after injury, and they are known to interact in complex inductive, inhibitive and synergistic manners in many developing systems. The interaction between BMP and Wnt signalling in OL development, however, has not been extensively explored. In the present study, we examine the relationship between the canonical Wnt and BMP pathways. We use pharmacological and genetic paradigms to show that both Wnt3a and BMP4 will inhibit OL differentiation in vitro. We also show that when the canonical BMP signalling pathway is blocked, neither Wnt3a nor BMP4 have inhibitory effects on OL differentiation. In contrast, abrogating the Wnt signalling pathway does not alter the actions of BMP4 treatment. Our results indicate that the BMP signalling pathway is necessary for the canonical Wnt signalling pathway to exert its effects on OL development, but not vice versa, suggesting that Wnt signals upstream of BMP.},

Here evidence is presented that the all-or-none character of the response is generated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Analysis of individual oocytes showed that the response of MAPK to progesterone or Mos was equivalent to that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of at least 35, more than 10 times the Hill coefficient for the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin.

In wide-field imaging, scattering of highly coherent laser light due to imperfections in the light path typically leads to nonuniform illumination of the specimen, compromising image analysis. We report the design and construction of an objective-launch total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy system with excellent evenness of specimen illumination achieved by azimuthal rotation of the incoming illuminating laser beam. The system allows quick and precise changes of the incidence angle of the laser beam and thus can also be used in an epifluorescence mode.},

abstract = {We have recently reported the chondrogenic effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in high density cultures of the mouse multipotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cell line and have shown the functional requirement of the cell-cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin in BMP-2-induced chondrogenesis in vitro (Denker, A. E., Nicoll, S. B., and Tuan, R. S. (1995) Differentiation 59, 25-34; Haas, A. R., and Tuan, R. S. (1999) Differentiation 64, 77-89). Furthermore, BMP-2 treatment also results in an increased protein level of beta-catenin, a known N-cadherin-associated Wnt signal transducer (Fischer, L., Haas, A., and Tuan, R. S. (2001) Signal Transduction 2, 66-78), suggesting functional cross-talk between the BMP-2 and Wnt signaling pathways. We have observed previously that BMP-2 treatment up-regulates expression of Wnt-3A in high density cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells. To assess the contribution of Wnt-3A to BMP-2-mediated chondrogenesis, we have generated C3H10T1/2 cell lines overexpressing Wnt-3A and various forms of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), an immediate cytosolic component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and examined their response to BMP-2. We show that overexpression of either Wnt-3A or kinase-dead GSK-3beta enhances BMP-2-mediated chondrogenesis. Furthermore, Wnt-3A overexpression results in decreases in both N-cadherin and GSK-3beta protein levels, whereas Wnt-3A as well as kinase-dead GSK-3beta overexpression increase total and nuclear levels of both beta-catenin and LEF-1. Direct cross-talk between Wnts and BMP-2 was also indicated by the up-regulated interaction between beta-catenin and SMAD-4 in response to BMP-2. These results suggest that Wnt-3A acts in a manner opposite to that of other Wnts, such as Wnt-7A, which were previously identified as inhibitory to chondrogenesis, and is the first BMP-2-regulated, chondrogenesis-enhancing member of the Wnt family.},

abstract = {Identified originally as a regulator of glycogen metabolism, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is now a well-established component of the Wnt signalling pathway, which is essential for setting up the entire body pattern during embryonic development. It may also play important roles in protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics and cell motility by phosphorylating initiation factors, components of the cell-division cycle, transcription factors and proteins involved in microtubule function and cell adhesion. Generation of the mouse knockout of GSK3beta, as well as studies in neurons, also suggest an important role in apoptosis. The substrate specificity of GSK3 is unusual in that efficient phosphorylation of many of its substrates requires the presence of another phosphorylated residue optimally located four amino acids C-terminal to the site of GSK3 phosphorylation. Recent experiments, including the elucidation of its three-dimensional structure, have enhanced our understanding of the molecular basis for the unique substrate specificity of GSK3. Insulin and growth factors inhibit GSK3 by triggering its phosphorylation, turning the N-terminus into a pseudosubstrate inhibitor that competes for binding with the 'priming phosphate' of substrates. In contrast, Wnt proteins inhibit GSK3 in a completely different way, by disrupting a multiprotein complex comprising GSK3 and its substrates in the Wnt signalling pathway, which do not appear to require a 'priming phosphate'. These latest findings have generated an enormous amount of interest in the development of drugs that inhibit GSK3 and which may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.},

Each protein in the database is displayed with its annotation, cDNA sequence, fluorescent images and movies obtained by the time-lapse microscopy. The protein dynamics in the database represents a quantitative trace of the protein fluorescence levels in nucleus and cytoplasm produced by image analysis of movies over time. Furthermore, a sequence analysis provides a search and comparison of up to 50 input DNA sequences with all cDNAs in the library. The raw movies may be useful as a benchmark for developing image analysis tools for individual-cell dynamic-proteomics. The database is available at http://www.dynamicproteomics.net/.},

The duration of the activated pSmad1(Cter) signal was regulated by sequential Smad1 linker region phosphorylations at conserved MAPK and GSK3 sites required for its polyubiquitinylation and transport to the centrosome. Proteasomal degradation of activated Smad1 and total polyubiquitinated proteins took place in the centrosome. Inhibitors of the Erk, p38, and JNK MAPKs, as well as GSK3 inhibitors, prolonged the duration of a pulse of BMP7. Wnt signaling decreased pSmad1(GSK3) antigen levels and redistributed it from the centrosome to cytoplasmic LRP6 signalosomes. In Xenopus embryos, it was found that Wnts induce epidermis and that this required an active BMP-Smad pathway. Epistatic experiments suggested that the dorsoventral (BMP) and anteroposterior (Wnt/GSK3) patterning gradients are integrated at the level of Smad1 phosphorylations during embryonic pattern formation.},

abstract = {Ligands of the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily (including the TGF-$\beta$s, Nodal and BMPs) play instructive roles during embryonic development. This is achieved by regulation of genes important for both maintaining pluripotency and germ layer specification and differentiation. Here we review how the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily ligands signal to the chromatin to regulate transcription during development. The effectors of the pathway, the Smad transcription factors, are regulated in a combinatorial and spatiotemporal manner. This occurs via post-translational modifications affecting stability, localization and activity, as well as through interactions with other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes, which occur on DNA. Expression profiling and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation has defined Smad target genes and binding sites at a genome-wide scale, which vary between cell types and differentiation stages. This has led to the insight that Smad-mediated transcriptional responses are influenced by the presence of master transcription factors, such as OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in embryonic stem cells, interaction with other signal-induced factors, as well as by the general chromatin remodeling machinery. Interplay with transcriptional repressors and the polycomb group proteins also regulate the balance between expression of self-renewal and mesendoderm-specific genes in embryonic stem cells and during early development.},

As a key component of Wnt signaling, Dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) protein relays Wnt signals from receptors to downstream effectors. In the canonical Wnt pathway that depends on the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, Dvl is recruited by the receptor Frizzled and prevents the constitutive destruction of cytosolic beta-catenin. In the non-canonical Wnt pathways such as Wnt-Frizzled/PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling, Dvl signals via the Daam1-RhoA axis and the Rac1 axis. In addition, Dvl plays important roles in Wnt-GSK3beta-microtubule signaling, Wnt-calcium signaling, Wnt-RYK signaling, Wnt-atypical PKC signaling, etc. Dvl also functions to mediate receptor endocytosis. To fulfill its multifaceted functions, it is not surprising that Dvl associates with various kinds of proteins. Its activity is also modulated dynamically by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of Dvl functions in Wnt signal transduction and its biological functions in mouse development, and also discuss the molecular mechanisms of its actions.},

Alterations in TGF-$\beta$ superfamily signaling are common in colon cancer; however, the role of T$\beta$RIII has not been examined. Although T$\beta$RIII expression is frequently lost at the message and protein level in human cancers and suppresses cancer progression in these contexts, here we demonstrate that, in colon cancer, T$\beta$RIII messenger RNA expression is not significantly altered and T$\beta$RIII expression is more frequently increased at the protein level, suggesting a distinct role for T$\beta$RIII in colon cancer. Increasing T$\beta$RIII expression in colon cancer model systems enhanced ligand-mediated phosphorylation of p38 and the Smad proteins, while switching TGF-$\beta$ and BMP-2 from inhibitors to stimulators of colon cancer cell proliferation, inhibiting ligand-induced p21 and p27 expression. In addition, increasing T$\beta$RIII expression increased ligand-stimulated anchorage-independent growth, a resistance to ligand- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, cell migration and modestly increased tumorigenicity in vivo. In a reciprocal manner, silencing endogenous T$\beta$RIII expression decreased colon cancer cell migration. These data support a model whereby T$\beta$RIII mediates TGF-$\beta$ superfamily ligand-induced colon cancer progression and support a context-dependent role for T$\beta$RIII in regulating cancer progression.},

abstract = {Cell-cell signaling pervades all aspects of development, not just in vertebrates, but in all animals (metazoa). It is a typifying characteristic of the major multicellular life forms, animals, plants, and fungi, which diverged about 1.2 billion years ago from a common ancestor descended from a lineage of unicellular life forms. In metazoa, at least 17 kinds of signal transduction pathways operate, each distinguished by its transduction intermediates. Five kinds predominate in early embryonic development, namely, the Wnt, TGF-beta, Hedgehog, RTK, and Notch pathways. Five more are used in late development, and seven more in the functions of differentiated cells. The pathways must have evolved and become conserved in pre-Cambrian times before the divergence of basal members of most of the modern phyla. In metazoan development and physiology, the responses of cells to intercellular signals include cell proliferation, secretion, motility, and transcription. These responses tend to be conserved among metazoa and shared with unicellular eukaryotes and in some cases even with unicellular prokaryotes. Protein components of the responses date back 2 billion years to ancestral eukaryotes or 3 billion to ancestral prokaryotes. Each metazoan developmental process consists of a network of signals and responses, and many of these networks are conserved among metazoa, for example, by insects and mammals. The study of model organisms, even of nonvertebrate groups, is expected to continue to contribute greatly to the understanding of mammalian development and to offer opportunities to analyze the effects of toxicants on development, as well as opportunities to devise incisive assays for toxicants.},

abstract = {Drugs and drug combinations have complex biological effects on cells and organisms. Little is known about how drugs affect protein dynamics that determine these effects. Here, we use a dynamic proteomics approach to accurately follow 15 protein levels in human cells in response to 13 different drugs. We find that protein dynamics in response to combinations of drugs are described accurately by a linear superposition (weighted sum) of their response to individual drugs. The weights in this superposition describe the relative impact of each drug on each protein. Using these weights, we show that one can predict the dynamics in a three-drug or four-drug combination on the basis of the dynamics in drug pairs. Our approach might eliminate the need to increase the number of experiments exponentially with the number of drugs and suggests that it might be possible to rationally control protein dynamics with specific drug combinations.},

abstract = {Many sensory systems, such as vision and hearing, show a response that is proportional to the fold-change in the stimulus relative to the background, a feature related to Weber’s law. Recent experiments suggest such a fold-change detection feature in signaling systems in cells: a response that depends on the fold-change in the input signal, and not on its absolute level (Cohen-Saidon et al., in press; Goentoro and Kirschner, submitted; both in this volume). It is therefore of interest to find molecular mechanisms of gene regulation that can provide such fold-change detection. Here we demonstrate theoretically that fold-change detection can be generated by one of the most common network motifs in transcription networks, the incoherent feedforward loop (I1-FFL), in which an activator regulates both a gene and a repressor of the gene.The fold-change detection feature of the I1-FFL applies to the entire shape of the response, including its amplitude and duration, and is valid for a wide range of biochemical parameters.},

Here, we report that ALK5 is important for TGF$\beta$/ALK1 signaling; endothelial cells lacking ALK5 are deficient in TGF$\beta$/ALK1-induced responses. More specifically, we show that ALK5 mediates a TGF$\beta$-dependent recruitment of ALK1 into a TGF$\beta$ receptor complex and that the ALK5 kinase activity is required for optimal ALK1 activation. TGF$\beta$ type II receptor is also required for ALK1 activation by TGF$\beta$. Interestingly, ALK1 not only induces a biological response opposite to that of ALK5 but also directly antagonizes ALK5/Smad signaling.},

We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are approximately 10\%. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles.},

abstract = {In the intestine, the canonical Wnt signaling cascade plays a crucial role in driving the proliferation of epithelial cells. Furthermore, aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer. Despite this evi- dence, little is known about the precise identity and localization of Wnts and their downstream effectors in the adult intestine. To address this issue, we examined the expression pattern of all Wnts, Frizzleds (Fzs), low- density lipoprotein receptor–related proteins, Wnt an- tagonists, and T-cell factors in the murine small intestine and colon and adenomas. Methods: Embryonic, postna- tal, and adult intestinal samples were subjected to in situ hybridization by using specific RNA probes for the various genes tested. Results: Our analysis showed high expression of several signaling components (including Wnt-3, Wnt-6, Wnt-9b, Frizzled 4, Frizzled 6, Frizzled 7, low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 5, and secreted Frizzled-related protein 5) in crypt epithelial cells. We also detected Wnt-2b, Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, Wnt-5b, Frizzled 4, and Frizzled 6 in differentiated epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the small intestine and colon. Finally, several factors (Frizzled 4, T-cell factor 1, lym- phoid enhancer factor, Dickkopf 2, Dickkopf 3, and Wnt-interacting factor) displayed differential expression in normal vs neoplastic tissue. Conclusions: Our study predicts a much broader role for Wnt signaling in gut development and homeostasis than was previously an- ticipated from available genetic studies and identifies novel factors likely involved in promoting canonical and noncanonical Wnt signals in the intestine. villi and crypts of Lieberk\"{u}hn.

Recent single molecule in vivo imaging has shown that it takes significant time for a transcription factor molecule to bind its chromosomal binding site. Given the slow association kinetics, transcription factor mediated feedback cannot at the same time be fast and strong. Here we show that with a limited association rate follows an optimal transcription factor binding strength where noise is maximally suppressed. At the optimal binding strength the binding site is free a fixed fraction of the time independent of the transcription factor concentration. One consequence is that high-copy number transcription factors should bind weakly to their operators, which is observed for transcription factors in Escherichia coli. The results demonstrate that a binding site's strength may be uncorrelated to its functional importance.},

Unlike complexes of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) branch that apparently form due to avidity from membrane localization, TGF-beta complexes assemble cooperatively through recruitment of the low-affinity (type I) receptor by the ligand-bound high-affinity (type II) pair. Here we report the crystal structure of TGF-beta3 in complex with the extracellular domains of both pairs of receptors, revealing that the type I docks and becomes tethered via unique extensions at a composite ligand-type II interface. Disrupting the receptor-receptor interactions conferred by these extensions abolishes assembly of the signaling complex and signal transduction (Smad activation). Although structurally similar, BMP and TGF-beta receptors bind in dramatically different modes, mediating graded and switch-like assembly mechanisms that may have coevolved with branch-specific groups of cytoplasmic effectors.},

abstract = {The broad range of biological responses elicited by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in various types of tissues and cells is mainly determined by the expression level and activity of the effector proteins Smad2 and Smad3. It is not fully understood how the baseline properties of Smad3 are regulated, although this molecule is in complex with many other proteins at the steady state. Here we show that nonactivated Smad3, but not Smad2, undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation due to the concerted action of the scaffolding protein Axin and its associated kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-beta). Smad3 physically interacts with Axin and GSK3-beta only in the absence of TGF-beta. Reduction in the expression or activity of Axin/GSK3-beta leads to increased Smad3 stability and transcriptional activity without affecting TGF-beta receptors or Smad2, whereas overexpression of these proteins promotes Smad3 basal degradation and desensitizes cells to TGF-beta. Mechanistically, Axin facilitates GSK3-beta-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3 at Thr66, which triggers Smad3 ubiquitination and degradation. Thr66 mutants of Smad3 show altered protein stability and hence transcriptional activity. These results indicate that the steady-state stability of Smad3 is an important determinant of cellular sensitivity to TGF-beta, and suggest a new function of the Axin/GSK3-beta complex in modulating critical TGF-beta/Smad3-regulated processes during development and tumor progression.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is involved in the vast majority of cellular processes and is fundamentally important during the entire life of all metazoans. Deregulation of TGF-beta/BMP activity almost invariably leads to developmental defects and/or diseases, including cancer. The proper functioning of the TGF-beta/BMP pathway depends on its constitutive and extensive communication with other signaling pathways, leading to synergistic or antagonistic effects and eventually desirable biological outcomes. The nature of such signaling cross-talk is overwhelmingly complex and highly context-dependent. Here we review the different modes of cross-talk between TGF-beta/BMP and the signaling pathways of Mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt, Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, and the interleukin/interferon-gamma/tumor necrosis factor-alpha cytokines, with an emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms.},

To examine the consequences of local Wnt signaling, we immobilized Wnt proteins on beads and introduced them to embryonic stem cells in culture. At the single-cell level, the Wnt-bead induced asymmetric distribution of Wnt–$\beta$-catenin signaling components, oriented the plane of mitotic division, and directed asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes. Before cytokinesis was completed, the Wnt-proximal daughter cell expressed high levels of nuclear $\beta$-catenin and pluripotency genes, whereas the distal daughter cell acquired hallmarks of differentiation. We suggest that a spatially restricted Wnt signal induces an oriented cell division that generates distinct cell fates at predictable positions relative to the Wnt source.},

abstract = {Numerous transcription factors (TFs) encode information about upstream signals in the dynamics of their activation, but how downstream genes decode these dynamics remains poorly understood. Using microfluidics to control the nucleocytoplasmic translocation dynamics of the budding yeast TF Msn2, we elucidate the principles that govern how different promoters convert dynamical Msn2 input into gene expression output in single cells. Combining modeling and experiments, we classify promoters according to their signal-processing behavior and reveal that multiple, distinct gene expression programs can be encoded in the dynamics of Msn2. We show that both oscillatory TF dynamics and slow promoter kinetics lead to higher noise in gene expression. Furthermore, we show that the promoter activation timescale is related to nucleosome remodeling. Our findings imply a fundamental trade-off: although the cell can exploit different promoter classes to differentially control gene expression using TF dynamics, gene expression noise fundamentally limits how much information can be encoded in the dynamics of a single TF and reliably decoded by promoters.},

Here, we report an unanticipated role for X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in regulating this critical Wnt signaling event that is independent of its antiapoptotic function. We identified DIAP1 as a positive regulator of Wingless signaling in a Drosophila S2 cell-based RNAi screen. XIAP, its vertebrate homolog, is similarly required for Wnt signaling in cultured mammalian cells and in Xenopus embryos, indicating evolutionary conservation of function. Upon Wnt pathway activation, XIAP is recruited to TCF/Lef where it monoubiquitylates Groucho (Gro)/TLE. This modification decreases affinity of Gro/TLE for TCF/Lef. Our data reveal a transcriptional switch involving XIAP-mediated ubiquitylation of Gro/TLE that facilitates its removal from TCF/Lef, thus allowing $\beta$-catenin-TCF/Lef complex assembly and initiation of a Wnt-specific transcriptional program.},

Inhibition of BMP signaling by transgenic expression of noggin results in the formation of numerous ectopic crypt units perpendicular to the crypt-villus axis. These changes phenocopy the intestinal histopathology of patients with the cancer predisposition syndrome juvenile polyposis (JP), including the frequent occurrence of intraepithelial neoplasia.

Finally, we investigated the expression of BMP2 in microadenomas from familial adenomatous polyposis patients. ￼: BMP receptors (BMPR) Ia, BMPR Ib, and BMPR II are all expressed in colonic epithelial cell lines. BMP2 inhibits colonic epithelial cell growth in vitro, promoting apoptosis and differentiation and inhibiting proliferation. BMP2, BMPRIa, BMPRIb, BMPRII, phosphorylated Smad1, and Smad4 are expressed predominantly in mature colonocytes at the epithelial surface in normal adult human and mouse colon.

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the prototype of a large family of structurally related cytokines that play key roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis by signaling through two classes of functionally distinct Ser/Thr kinase receptors, designated as type I and type II. TGF-beta initiates receptor assembly by binding with high affinity to the type II receptor. Here, we present the 2.15 A crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human TGF-beta type II receptor (ecTbetaR2) in complex with human TGF-beta3. ecTbetaR2 interacts with homodimeric TGF-beta3 by binding identical finger segments at opposite ends of the growth factor. Relative to the canonical 'closed' conformation previously observed in ligand structures across the superfamily, ecTbetaR2-bound TGF-beta3 shows an altered arrangement of its monomeric subunits, designated the 'open' conformation. The mode of TGF-beta3 binding shown by ecTbetaR2 is compatible with both ligand conformations. This, in addition to the predicted mode for TGF-beta binding to the type I receptor ectodomain (ecTbetaR1), suggests an assembly mechanism in which ecTbetaR1 and ecTbetaR2 bind at adjacent positions on the ligand surface and directly contact each other via protein--protein interactions.},

In colorectal cancer, activating Wnt pathway mutations transform epithelial cells through the inappropriate activation of a TCF7L2/TCF4 target gene program. Through a DNA array-based genome-wide analysis of TCF4 chromatin occupancy, we have identified 6,868 high-confidence TCF4-binding sites in the LS174T colorectal cancer cell line. Most TCF4-binding sites are located at large distances from transcription start sites, while target genes are frequently "decorated" by multiple binding sites. Motif discovery algorithms define the in vivo-occupied TCF4-binding site as evolutionarily conserved A-C/G-A/T-T-C-A-A-A-G motifs. The TCF4-binding regions significantly correlate with Wnt-responsive gene expression profiles derived from primary human adenomas and often behave as beta-catenin/TCF4-dependent enhancers in transient reporter assays.},

Here, the c-MYC on- cogene is identified as a target gene in this signaling pathway. Expression of c-MYC was shown to be repressed by wild-type APC and activated by ?-catenin, and these effects were mediated through Tcf-4 binding sites in the c-MYC promoter.

We now provide evidence that lithium activates downstream components of the wnt signaling pathway in vivo, leading to accumulation of beta-catenin protein. Our data indicate that this activation of the wnt pathway is a consequence of inhibition of GSK-3 beta by lithium. Using a novel assay for GSK-3 beta in oocytes, we show that lithium inhibits GSK-3 beta from species as diverse as Dictyostelium discoideum and Xenopus laevis, providing a biochemical mechanism for the action of lithium on the development of these organisms. Lithium treatment also leads to activation of an AP-1-luciferase reporter in Xenopus embryos, consistent with previous observations that GSK-3 beta inhibits c-jun activity. Activation of the wnt pathway with a dominant negative form of GSK-3 beta is inhibited by myo-inositol, similar to the previously described effect of coinjecting myo-inositol with lithium. The mechanism by which myo-inositol inhibits both dominant negative GSK-3 beta and lithium remains uncertain.},

abstract = {Despite more than 30 years of work on the Wnt signaling pathway, the basic mechanism of how the extracellular Wnt signal increases the intracellular concentration of $\beta$-catenin is still contentious. Circumventing much of the detailed biochemistry, we used basic principles of chemical kinetics coupled with quantitative measurements to define the reactions on $\beta$-catenin directly affected by the Wnt signal. We conclude that the core signal transduction mechanism is relatively simple, with only two regulated phosphorylation steps. Their partial inhibition gives rise to the full dynamics of the response and subsequently maintains a steady state in which the concentration of $\beta$-catenin is increased.},

abstract = {Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are pivotal in colorectal tumorigenesis. Existing mouse intestinal tumor models display mainly small intestinal lesions and carcinomas are rare. We defined human CDX2 sequences conferring colon epithelium-preferential transgene expression in the adult mouse. Mice carrying a CDX2P-NLS Cre recombinase transgene and a loxP-targeted Apc allele developed mainly colorectal tumors, with carcinomas seen in 6 of 36 (17\%) of mice followed for 300 days. Like human colorectal lesions, the mouse tumors showed biallelic Apc inactivation, beta-catenin dysregulation, global DNA hypomethylation, and aneuploidy. The predominantly distal colon and rectal distribution of tumors seen in mice where one Apc allele was inactivated in epithelial cells from distal ileum to rectum suggests that regional differences in the intestinal tract in the frequency and nature of secondary genetic and epigenetic events associated with adenoma outgrowth have a contributing role in determining where adenomas develop. The presence of large numbers of small intestine tumors seemed to inhibit colorectal tumor development in the mouse, and gender-specific effects on tumor multiplicity in the distal mouse colon and rectum mimic the situation in humans where males have a larger number of advanced adenomas and carcinomas in the distal colon and rectum than females. The mouse model of colon-preferential gene targeting described here should facilitate efforts to define novel factors and mechanisms contributing to human colon tumor pathogenesis, as well as work on tumor-promoting environmental factors and agents and strategies for cancer prevention and treatment.},

The CCD, with its high resolution, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, photometric accuracy, and geometric stability, can provide data of such high quality that quantitative analysis on two- and three-dimensional microscopic images is possible. For example, the three-dimensional imaging properties of an epifluorescence microscope have been quantitatively determined with the CCD. This description of the imaging properties of the microscope, and the high-quality image data provided by the CCD, allow sophisticated computational image processing methods to be used that greatly improve the effective resolution obtainable for biological structures.

abstract = {Cellular signal transduction machinery integrates information from multiple inputs to actuate discrete cellular behaviors. Interaction complexity exists when an input modulates the output behavior that results from other inputs. To address whether this machinery is iteratively complex--that is, whether increasing numbers of inputs produce exponential increases in discrete cellular behaviors--we examined the modulated secretion of six cytokines from macrophages in response to up to five-way combinations of an agonist of Toll-like receptor 4, three cytokines, and conditions that activated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate pathway. Although all of the selected ligands showed synergy in paired combinations, few examples of nonadditive outputs were found in response to higher-order combinations. This suggests that most potential interactions are not realized and that unique cellular responses are limited to discrete subsets of ligands and pathways that enhance specific cellular functions.},

abstract = {Renal dysplasia, the major cause of childhood renal failure in humans, arises from perturbed renal morphogenesis and molecular signaling during embryogenesis. Recently, we discovered induction of molecular crosstalk between Smad1 and beta-catenin in the TgAlk3QD mouse model of renal medullary cystic dysplasia. Our finding that Myc, a Smad and beta-catenin transcriptional target and effector of renal epithelial dedifferentiation, is misexpressed in dedifferentiated epithelial tubules provided a basis for investigating coordinate transcriptional control by Smad1 and beta-catenin in disease. Here, we report enhanced interactions between a molecular complex consisting of Smad1, beta-catenin and Tcf4 and adjacent Tcf- and Smad-binding regions located within the Myc promoter in TgAlk3QD dysplastic renal tissue, and Bmp-dependent cooperative control of Myc transcription by Smad1, beta-catenin and Tcf4. Analysis of nuclear extracts derived from TgAlk3QD and wild-type renal tissue revealed increased levels of Smad1/beta-catenin molecular complexes, and de novo formation of chromatin-associated Tcf4/Smad1 molecular complexes in TgAlk3QD tissues. Analysis of a 476 nucleotide segment of the 1490 nucleotide Myc genomic region upstream of the transcription start site demonstrated interactions between Tcf4 and the Smad consensus binding region and associations of Smad1, beta-catenin and Tcf4 with oligo-duplexes that encode the adjacent Tcf- and Smad-binding elements only in TgAlk3QD tissues. In collecting duct cells that express luciferase under the control of the 1490 nucleotide Myc genomic region, Bmp2-dependent stimulation of Myc transcription was dependent on contributions by each of Tcf4, beta-catenin and Smad1. These results provide novel insights into mechanisms by which interacting signaling pathways control transcription during the genesis of renal dysplasia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question of how genomic processes, such as gene duplication, give rise to co-ordinated organismal properties, such as emergence of new body plans, organs and lifestyles, is of importance in developmental and evolutionary biology. Herein, we focus on the diversification of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway -- one of the fundamental and versatile metazoan signal transduction engines.

RESULTS: After an investigation of 33 genomes, we show that the emergence of the TGF-beta pathway coincided with appearance of the first known animal species. The primordial pathway repertoire consisted of four Smads and four receptors, similar to those observed in the extant genome of the early diverging tablet animal (Trichoplax adhaerens). We subsequently retrace duplications in ancestral genomes on the lineage leading to humans, as well as lineage-specific duplications, such as those which gave rise to novel Smads and receptors in teleost fishes. We conclude that the diversification of the TGF-beta pathway can be parsimoniously explained according to the 2R model, with additional rounds of duplications in teleost fishes. Finally, we investigate duplications followed by accelerated evolution which gave rise to an atypical TGF-beta pathway in free-living bacterial feeding nematodes of the genus Rhabditis.

CONCLUSION: Our results challenge the view of well-conserved developmental pathways. The TGF-beta signal transduction engine has expanded through gene duplication, continually adopting new functions, as animals grew in anatomical complexity, colonized new environments, and developed an active immune system.},

@article{Hussein2003,
abstract = {Recent in vivo evidence suggests that Wnt signaling plays a central role in determining the fate of stem cells in the ectoderm and in the neural crest by modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) levels, which, in turn, influence Msx gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of the Msx genes as key regulators of cell fate has not been elucidated. Here we show in murine embryonic stem cells that BMP-dependent activation of Msx2 is mediated via the cooperative binding of Smad4 at two Smad binding elements and of lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef1) at two Lef1/TCF binding sites. Lef1 can synergize with Smad4 and Smad1 to activate Msx2 promoter, and this transcriptional complex is assembled on the endogenous promoter in response to BMP2. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway can activate Msx2 via the binding of Lef1 to its promoter and synergizes with BMP2 to activate Msx2 expression, possibly via enhanced recruitment of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein co-factor. Interestingly, the Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent activation of Msx2 was defective in Smad4-deficient embryonic stem cells or when Smad binding elements were mutated but persisted in the presence of various BMP antagonists, indicating that Smad4 was involved in transducing the Wnt/beta-catenin signals in the absence of a BMP autocrine loop. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous Smad4, but not Smad1, was part of the Lef1 transcriptional complex in response to beta-catenin activation, dismissing any implication of BMP signaling in this response. We propose that Wnt signaling pathway could dictate cell fate not only by modulating BMP levels but also by directly regulating cooperatively BMP-target genes.},

abstract = {Colorectal carcinomas (CRC) that arise proximal (right) or distal (left) to the splenic flexure exhibit differences in incidence according to geographic region, age and gender. Together with observations that tumours in the hereditary cancer syndromes HNPCC and FAP occur predominantly in the right and left colon, respectively, the existence of 2 categories of CRC based on site of origin in the large bowel was proposed more than a decade ago. Differences between normal right and left colonic segments that could favour progression through different tumourigenic pathways are summarized in this review. Accumulating evidence suggests that the risk of CRC conferred by various environmental and genetic factors is different for proximal and distal tumours. Right- and left-sided tumours also exhibit different sensitivities to fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Such differences are probably related to the molecular characteristics of the tumours, with the microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotypes being associated with right-sided tumours and chromosomal instability with left-sided tumours. Future molecular-based classification systems for CRC that rely upon distinctive gene expression patterns may allow a clearer discrimination of subgroups than that provided by tumour site alone. Until then however, the existence of 2 broadly different groups of cancer defined by site of origin in the colon should be considered in the design of future epidemiologic studies as well as in the design of new clinical trials aimed at testing novel adjuvant therapies.},

Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.},

Several E3 ubiquitin ligases play a crucial role in the recognition and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of TGF-$\beta$ family receptors, Smad proteins and their interacted proteins to regulate positively and negatively TGF-$\beta$ family signaling. In contrast, non-degradative ubiquitin modifications also regulate TGF-$\beta$ family signaling. Recently, in addition to protein ubiquitination, deubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes has been reported to control TGF-$\beta$ family signaling pathways. Interestingly, more recent studies suggest that TGF-$\beta$ signaling is not only regulated via ubiquitination and/or deubiquitination, but also it relies on ubiquitination for its effect on other pathways. Thus, ubiquitin modifications play key roles in TGF-$\beta$ family signal transduction and cross-talk between TGF-$\beta$ family signaling and other signaling pathways. Here, we review the current understandings of the positive and negative regulatory mechanisms by ubiquitin modifications that control TGF-$\beta$ family signaling.},

abstract = {Small molecule inhibitors have proven extremely useful for investigating signal transduction pathways and have the potential for development into therapeutics for inhibiting signal transduction pathways whose activities contribute to human diseases. Transforming growth factor \{beta\} (TGF-\{beta\}) is a member of a large family of pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in many biological processes, including growth control, differentiation, migration, cell survival, adhesion, and specification of developmental fate, in both normal and diseased states. TGF-\{beta\} superfamily members signal through a receptor complex comprising a type II and type I receptor, both serine/threonine kinases. Here, we characterize a small molecule inhibitor (SB-431542) that was identified as an inhibitor of activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5 (the TGF-\{beta\} type I receptor). We demonstrate that it inhibits ALK5 and also the activin type I receptor ALK4 and the nodal type I receptor ALK7, which are very highly related to ALK5 in their kinase domains. It has no effect on the other, more divergent ALK family members that recognize bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Consistent with this, we demonstrate that SB-431542 is a selective inhibitor of endogenous activin and TGF-\{beta\} signaling but has no effect on BMP signaling. To demonstrate the specificity of SB-431542, we tested its effect on several other signal transduction pathways whose activities depend on the concerted activation of multiple kinases. SB-431542 has no effect on components of the ERK, JNK, or p38 MAP kinase pathways or on components of the signaling pathways activated in response to serum.},

Here we demonstrate that, following TGF-$\beta$ stimulation of epithelial cells, receptors remain active for at least 3–4 hr, and continuous receptor activity is required to maintain active Smads in the nucleus and for TGF-$\beta$-induced transcription. We show that continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the Smads during active TGF-$\beta$ signaling provides the mechanism whereby the intracellular transducers of the signal continuously monitor receptor activity. Our data therefore explain how, at all times, the concentration of active Smads in the nucleus is directly dictated by the levels of activated receptors in the cytoplasm.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

We identified a population of cells in the adult lung that bear the EpCAM+CD104+CD49f+CD44+CD24loSCA1+ phenotype and can be clonally expanded in culture, consistent with the properties of early progenitor cells. We show that these cells, rather than being restricted to one tumor type, can give rise to several different types of cancer, including adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. We further demonstrate that these cells can be converted from one cancer type to the other, and this plasticity is determined by their responsiveness to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. Our data establish a mechanistic link between TGF-beta signaling and SOX2 expression, and identify the TGF-beta/SMAD/SOX2 signaling network as a key regulator of lineage commitment and differentiation of lung cancer cells.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 28 March 2014; doi:10.1038/cdd.2014.38.},

@article{Issaeva2010,
abstract = {Understanding the dynamic relationship between components of a system or pathway at the individual cell level is a current challenge. To address this, we developed an approach that allows simultaneous tracking of several endogenous proteins of choice within individual living human cells. The approach is based on fluorescent tagging of proteins at their native locus by directed gene targeting. A fluorescent tag-encoding DNA is introduced as a new exon into the intronic region of the gene of interest, resulting in expression of a full-length fluorescently tagged protein. We used this approach to establish human cell lines simultaneously expressing two components of a major antioxidant defense system, thioredoxin 1 (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), labeled with CFP and YFP, respectively. We find that the distributions of both proteins between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments were highly variable between cells. However, the two proteins did not vary independently of each other: protein levels of Trx and TrxR1 in both the whole cell and the nucleus were substantially correlated. We further find that in response to a stress-inducing drug (CPT), both Trx and TrxR1 accumulated in the nuclei in a manner that was highly temporally correlated. This accumulation considerably reduced cell-to-cell variability in nuclear content of both proteins, suggesting a uniform response of the thioredoxin system to stress. These results indicate that Trx and TrxR1 act in concert in response to stress in regard to both time course and variability. Thus, our approach provides an efficient tool for studying dynamic relationship between components of systems of interest at a single-cell level.},

abstract = {The Wnt and the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathways are evolutionarily conserved and essentially independent signaling mechanisms, which, however, often regulate similar biological processes. Wnt and BMP signaling are functionally integrated in many biological processes, such as embryonic patterning in Drosophila and vertebrates, formation of kidney, limb, teeth and bones, maintenance of stem cells, and cancer progression. Detailed inspection of regulation in these and other tissues reveals that Wnt and BMP signaling are functionally integrated in four fundamentally different ways. The molecular mechanism evolved to mediate this integration can also be summarized in four different ways. However, a fundamental aspect of functional and mechanistic interaction between these pathways relies on tissue-specific mechanisms, which are often not conserved and cannot be extrapolated to other tissues. Integration of the two pathways contributes toward the sophisticated means necessary for creating the complexity of our bodies and the reliable and healthy function of its tissues and organs.},

Here,weinvestigate the design principles governing the dynamics of these propor- tions during crypt morphogenesis. Using optimal control theory, we show that a proliferation strategy known as a ‘‘bang-bang’’ control minimizes the time to obtain a mature crypt. This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, estab- lishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other develop- mental systems.},

abstract = {Clefting of the soft palate occurs as a congenital defect in humans and adversely affects the physiological function of the palate. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism of clefting of the soft palate remains unclear because few animal models exhibit an isolated cleft in the soft palate. Using three-dimensional microCT images and histological reconstruction, we found that loss of TGF$\beta$ signaling in the palatal epithelium led to soft palate muscle defects in Tgfbr2(fl/fl);K14-Cre mice. Specifically, muscle mass was decreased in the soft palates of Tgfbr2 mutant mice, following defects in cell proliferation and differentiation. Gene expression of Dickkopf (Dkk1 and Dkk4), negative regulators of WNT-$\beta$-catenin signaling, is upregulated in the soft palate of Tgfbr2(fl/fl);K14-Cre mice, and WNT-$\beta$-catenin signaling is disrupted in the palatal mesenchyme. Importantly, blocking the function of DKK1 and DKK4 rescued the cell proliferation and differentiation defects in the soft palate of Tgfbr2(fl/fl);K14-Cre mice. Thus, our findings indicate that loss of TGF$\beta$ signaling in epithelial cells compromises activation of WNT signaling and proper muscle development in the soft palate through tissue-tissue interactions, resulting in a cleft soft palate. This information has important implications for prevention and non-surgical correction of cleft soft palate.},

One site is dominated by a palmitoleic acid lipid group projecting from serine 187 at the tip of Wnt's thumb into a deep groove in the Fz8-CRD. In the second binding site, the conserved tip of Wnt's "index finger" forms hydrophobic amino acid contacts with a depression on the opposite side of the Fz8-CRD. The conservation of amino acids in both interfaces appears to facilitate ligand-receptor cross-reactivity, which has important implications for understanding Wnt's functional pleiotropy and for developing Wnt-based drugs for cancer and regenerative medicine.},

In the past several years, models have influenced the way we talk about signalling networks, how we monitor them, and what we conclude when we perturb them. These insights required wet-lab experiments but would not have arisen without explicit computational modelling and quantitative analysis. Today, the best modellers are cross-trained investigators in experimental biology who work closely with collaborators but also undertake experimental work in their own laboratories. Biologists would benefit by becoming conversant in core principles of modelling in order to identify when a computational model could be a useful complement to their experiments.

TNF receptor (TNFR) has been studied in considerable detail, but it is not known how crosstalk among antagonistic pro- and antiapoptotic signals is achieved. Here we report an experimental and computational analysis of crosstalk between prodeath TNF and prosurvival growth factors in human epithelial cells. By applying classifier-based regression to a cytokine-signaling compendium of approximately 8000 intracellular protein measurements, we demonstrate that cells respond to TNF both directly, via activated TNF receptor, and indirectly, via the sequential release of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We refer to the contingent and time-varying series of extracellular signals induced by TNF as an "autocrine cascade." Time-dependent crosstalk of synergistic and antagonistic autocrine circuits may serve to link cellular responses to the local environment.},

Here we describe an approach to comprehensively identify co-regulated, heterogeneously expressed genes among cells that otherwise appear identical. The technique, called stochastic profiling, involves repeated, random selection of very small cell populations via laser-capture microdissection followed by a customized single-cell amplification procedure and transcriptional profiling. Fluctuations in the resulting gene-expression measurements are then analyzed statistically to identify transcripts that are heterogeneously coexpressed. We stochastically profiled matrix-attached human epithelial cells in a three-dimensional culture model of mammary-acinar morphogenesis. Of 4,557 transcripts, we identified 547 genes with strong cell-to-cell expression differences. Clustering of this heterogeneous subset revealed several molecular 'programs' implicated in protein biosynthesis, oxidative-stress responses and NF-kappaB signaling, which we independently confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, stochastic profiling can reveal single-cell heterogeneities without the need to measure expression in individual cells.},

abstract = {A self-inactivating CD-tagging retroviral vector was used to introduce epitope and GFP tags into genes and proteins in NIH 3T3 cells. Several hundred cell clones, each expressing GFP fluorescence in a distinctive pattern, were isolated. Molecular analysis showed that a wide variety of genes and proteins, some known and some newly discovered, had been tagged. The analysis also revealed that, in the great majority of instances, the abundance and cellular location of the tagged protein mirrored that of its untagged counterpart. This approach provides a systematic means for the functional annotation of mammalian genomes and proteomes in living cells.},

abstract = {We describe a new method for gene dis- covery and analysis, CD-tagging, that puts specific molecular tags on a gene, its tran- script and its protein product. The method has been successfully tested in two organ- isms, the haploid unicellular alga Chlamy- domonas reinhardtii and the metazoan Dro- sophila melanogaster. The method utilizes a specially designed DNA molecule, the CD- cassette, that contains splice acceptor and donor sites surrounding a short open read- ing frame. Insertion of the CD-cassette into an intron in a target gene introduces a new exon, represented by the open reading frame of the CD-cassette, surrounded by two functional hybrid introns. As a result (i) the gene is tagged by a specific nu- cleotide sequence, (ii) the mRNA is tagged by a specific nucleotide sequence and (iii) the protein is tagged by a specific peptide sequence. Because these tags are unique, specific nucleotide or antibody probes can be used to obtain and/or analyze the gene, transcript or protein. As a gene discovery technology, CD-tagging has two unique ad- vantages: 1) Genes can be identified through a primary screen at the protein lev- el, and so the very process by which a gene is identified provides specific empirical in- formation about its biological function. 2) The cassette arms, which are spliced out of the transcript of the target gene, are avail- able to carry a wide variety of DNA se- quences, such as genes encoding drug resis- tance that can be used to select for the presence of the CD-cassette in the genome.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3\% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5\% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0\% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80\% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3\%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

abstract = {In this study we investigated whether signalling by TGF-beta3 and Wnt-5a cross-talk during chondrogenic differentiation of chick wing mesenchyme. Using differential display polymerase chain reaction screening, we found the expression of Wnt-5a to be significantly increased during transforming growth factor-beta3 (TGF-beta3)-induced precartilage condensation in mesenchyme micromass cultures. Transfection of cells with a Wnt-5a expression construct promoted precartilage condensation and chondrogenesis in micromass cultures, similar to that observed when chondrogenic-competent cells were exposed to TGF-beta3. Overexpression of Wnt-5a or treatment with TGF-beta3 stimulated the activation of protein kinase C-alpha (PKC-alpha) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both positive regulators of chondrogenic differentiation. Inactivation of PKC-alpha and p38 MAPK by specific inhibitors abrogated chondrogenesis stimulated by both TGF-beta3 and Wnt-5a. Similarly, partial reduction in TGF-beta3-induced Wnt-5a expression by small interfering RNA resulted in decreased activities of PKC-alpha and p38 MAPK, and abolished the chondro-stimulatory effect of TGF-beta3. Collectively, these findings indicate that Wnt-5a, a non-canonical Wnt, can mediate the chondro-stimulatory effect of TGF-beta3 through upregulation of PKC-alpha and p38MAPK signaling.},

abstract = {There is evidence that pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells is associated with the activity of a network of transcription factors with Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog at the core. Using fluorescent reporters for the expression of Nanog, we observed that a population of ES cells is best described by a dynamic distribution of Nanog expression characterized by two peaks defined by high (HN) and low (LN) Nanog expression. Typically, the LN state is 5\%-20\% of the total population, depending on the culture conditions. Modelling of the activity of Nanog reveals that a simple network of Oct4/Sox2 and Nanog activity can account for the observed distribution and its properties as long as the transcriptional activity is tuned by transcriptional noise. The model also predicts that the LN state is unstable, something that is born out experimentally. While in this state, cells can differentiate. We suggest that transcriptional fluctuations in Nanog expression are an essential element of the pluripotent state and that the function of Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog is to act as a network that promotes and maintains transcriptional noise to interfere with the differentiation signals.},

In this study, we show that there are at least two TGF-beta-binding sites in betaglycan. Bacterially expressed fragments bg 1,2 and bg3, which represent the N-terminal two-thirds and C-terminal one-third of betaglycan extracellular domain, both competed for the binding of 125I-TGF-beta to mink lung epithelial cells. 125I-bg1,2 bound to immobilized TGF-beta with an affinity about 4-fold higher than bg3 had. Both bg3 and bg1,2 enhanced the bioactivity of TGF-beta. The whole ectodomain of betaglycan was more active than either bg3 or bg1,2 in the assays. The binding of 125I-bg3 to TGF-beta was inhibited by bg1,2 and vice versa. The binding of 125I-bg3 and 125I-bg1,2 to TGF-beta was also inhibited by the small decorin family of proteoglycans. These results indicate that there are at least two binding sites for TGF-beta in betaglycan and that these sites recognize the same or overlapping sites in TGF-beta.},

Accurate identification of a transcription factor's targets is essential to understanding the role that factors play in disease biology. However, due to a high false positive rate, identifying coherent functional target sets is difficult. We have created an improved mapping of targets by integrating ChIP-Seq data with 423 functional modules derived from 9,395 human expression experiments. We identified 5,002 TF-module relationships, significantly improved TF target prediction, and found 30 high-confidence TF-TF associations, of which 14 are known. Importantly, we also connected TFs to diseases through these functional modules and identified 3,859 significant TF-disease relationships. As an example, we found a link between MEF2A and Crohn's disease, which we validated in an independent expression dataset. These results show the power of combining expression data and ChIP-Seq data to remove noise and better extract the associations between TFs, functional modules, and disease.},

Binding epitopes for these extracellular signaling proteins have been defined, but hot spots specifying binding affinity and specificity have so far not been identified. In this study, mutational and structural analyses show that epitopes of BMP-2 and the BRIA receptor form a new type of protein-protein interface. The main chain atoms of Leu 51 and Asp53 of BMP-2 represent a hot spot of binding to BRIA. The BMP-2 variant L51P was deficient in type I receptor binding only, whereas its overall structure and its binding to type II receptors and modulator proteins, such as noggin, were unchanged. Thus, the L51P substitution converts BMP-2 into a receptor-inactive inhibitor of noggin. These results are relevant for other proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily and provide useful clues for structure-based drug design.},

@article{Khalil1999,
abstract = {The transforming growth factor-betas (TGF-$\beta$s) are synthesized as precursor proteins that are modified intracellularly prior to secretion. One of the most relevant intracellular modifications is the cleavage of the C-terminal pro-region from the N-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal pro-region is referred to as the latency-associated peptide (LAP) while the N-terminal region is called the mature TGF-$\beta$ or active TGF-$\beta$. However, with some exceptions the LAP noncovalently associates with the mature TGF-$\beta$ prior to secretion. When the mature TGF-$\beta$ is associated with the LAP it is called L-TGF-$\beta$ and cannot interact with its receptor and has no biological effect. The TGF-$\beta$s and their receptors are very ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that the regulation of TGF-$\beta$ activity is likely to be complex and multifactorial. However, one of the most important means of controlling the biological effects of TGF-$\beta$ is the regulation of converting L-TGF-$\beta$ to active TGF-$\beta$. The current literature supports two major mechanisms of activation of L-TGF-$\beta$ and suggests that the mechanism of activation of L-TGF-$\beta$ may be varied and context-dependent. For TGF-$\beta$ to become biologically active the LAP has to be either released from its associations with L-TGF-$\beta$ or undergo conformational change such that the LAP is not released from the L-TGF-$\beta$ complex but exposes the TGF-$\beta$ receptor binding site. Since TGF-$\beta$ has been associated with the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, the various mechanisms of activation of L-TGF-$\beta$ in context offer the possibility of controlling TGF-$\beta$ activity localized to the organ of involvement and to a more specific disease process.},
annote = {C-terminus of pro-pre-protein TGFB is Latency-associated peptide (LAP) that is cleaved off intracellular during maturation but stays noncovalently associate during secretion. As of writing, the LAP association seemed to be the most important form of TGFB activity regulation. A yet larger latent complex is formed with the addition of latency binding protein (LTBP). Reference reports that serine proteases and others can convert L-TGFB to TGFB (most studies were with TGFB1 specifically -- unclear if true of 2 \& 3). [If my result caused by such proteases, the washes should reduce the effect.] ROS can also activate L-TGFB (but may need to be large amounts). At least one integrin shown to activate it.},

abstract = {Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling has a variety of roles in regulating stem cell fates. Its specific role in mouse epiblast stem cell self-renewal, however, remains poorly understood. Here we show that Wnt/$\beta$-catenin functions in both self-renewal and differentiation in mouse epiblast stem cells. Stabilization and nuclear translocation of $\beta$-catenin and its subsequent binding to T-cell factors induces differentiation. Conversely, retention of stabilized $\beta$-catenin in the cytoplasm maintains self-renewal. Cytoplasmic retention of $\beta$-catenin is effected by stabilization of Axin2, a downstream target of $\beta$-catenin, or by genetic modifications to $\beta$-catenin that prevent its nuclear translocation. We also find that human embryonic stem cell and mouse epiblast stem cell fates are regulated by $\beta$-catenin through similar mechanisms. Our results elucidate a new role for $\beta$-catenin in stem cell self-renewal that is independent of its transcriptional activity and will have broad implications in understanding the molecular regulation of stem cell fate.},

abstract = {Normal human colonic epithelial cells (HCEC) are not immortalized by telomerase alone but also require CDK4. Some human cell types growth arrest due to stress or aberrant signaling induced senescence (stasis). Stasis represents the consequences of growth conditions in culture that are inadequate to maintain long-term proliferation. Overexpressed CDK4 titers out p16 and allows cells to ignore the growth arrest signals produced by stasis. In order to identify factors contributing to the inadequate culture environment, we used a 62,000 member shRNA library to knock down factors cooperating with hTERT in the immortalization of HCECs. Knockdown of Klotho gamma (KLG: also known as KLPH, LCTL) allowed hTERT to immortalize HCEC cells. KLG is one isoform of the Klotho family of factors that coordinate interaction between different FGF ligands and the FGF receptor. We also found that knockdown of KLG induced another member of the Klotho family, Klotho beta (KLB). Induction of KLB was maintained and can activate ERK1/2 in immortalized cells. Supplementation of the culture medium with the KLB ligand FGF19 had a similar effect on hTERT expressing HCEC as knock down of KLG, both regarding immortalization and the down regulation of the tumor suppressor Klotho alpha (KLA). Together, these data suggest that KLB is an important regulator in the immortalization of HCEC cells by facilitating FGF19 growth factor signaling.},

abstract = {Several described growth factors influence the proliferation and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. Using a transgenic mouse model, we identified a human gene, R-spondin1, with potent and specific proliferative effects on intestinal crypt cells. Human R-spondin1 (hRSpo1) is a thrombospondin domain-containing protein expressed in enteroendocrine cells as well as in epithelial cells in various tissues. Upon injection into mice, the protein induced rapid onset of crypt cell proliferation involving beta-catenin stabilization, possibly by a process that is distinct from the canonical Wnt-mediated signaling pathway. The protein also displayed efficacy in a model of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis and may have therapeutic application in gastrointestinal diseases.},

abstract = {The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, the largest subfamily of the structurally conserved transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of growth factors, are multifunctional regulators of development, proliferation, and differentiation. The TGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIII or betaglycan) is an abundant cell surface proteoglycan that has been well characterized as a TGF-beta and inhibin receptor. Here we demonstrate that TbetaRIII functions as a BMP cell surface receptor. TbetaRIII directly and specifically binds to multiple members of the BMP subfamily, including BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, and GDF-5, with similar kinetics and ligand binding domains as previously identified for TGF-beta. TbetaRIII also enhances ligand binding to the BMP type I receptors, whereas short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous TbetaRIII attenuates BMP-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation. Using a biologically relevant model for TbetaRIII function, we demonstrate that BMP-2 specifically stimulates TbetaRIII-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal cell transformation. The ability of TbetaRIII to serve as a cell surface receptor and mediate BMP, inhibin, and TGF-beta signaling suggests a broader role for TbetaRIII in orchestrating TGF-beta superfamily signaling.},

Alternatively, they can orient their division plane so that only one of the two daughter cells maintains contact with the niche and stem cell identity.

Furthermore, inactivation of Hes1 facilitated neural differentiation more uniformly at earlier time. Thus, Hes1-null ES cells display less heterogeneity in both the differentiation timing and fate choice, suggesting that the cyclic gene Hes1 contributes to heterogeneous responses of ES cells even under the same environmental conditions.},

abstract = {How complex signaling networks shape highly coordinated, multistep cellular responses is poorly understood. Here, we made use of a network-perturbation approach to investigate causal influences, or "crosstalk," among signaling modules involved in the cytoskeletal response of neutrophils to chemoattractant. We quantified the intensity and polarity of cytoskeletal marker proteins over time to characterize stereotyped cellular responses. Analyzing the effects of network disruptions revealed that, not only does crosstalk evolve rapidly during polarization, but also that intensity and polarity responses are influenced by different patterns of crosstalk. Interestingly, persistent crosstalk is arranged in a surprisingly simple circuit: a linear cascade from front to back to microtubules influences intensities, and a feed-forward network in the reverse direction influences polarity. Our approach provided a rational strategy for decomposing a complex, dynamically evolving signaling system and revealed evolving paths of causal influence that shape the neutrophil polarization response.},

abstract = {Multipotent differentiation, where cells adopt one of several possible fates, occurs in diverse systems ranging from bacteria to mammals. This decision-making process is driven by multiple differentiation programs that operate simultaneously in the cell. How these programs interact to govern cell fate choice is poorly understood. To investigate this issue,we simultaneously measured activities of the competing sporulation and competence programs in single Bacillus subtilis cells. This approach revealed that these competing differentiation programs progress independently without cross-regulation before the decision point. Cells seem to arrive at a fate choice through differences in the relative timing between the two programs. To test this proposed dynamic mechanism, we altered the relative timing by engineering artificial cross-regulation between the sporulation and competence circuits. Results suggest a simple model that does not require a checkpoint or intricate cross-regulation before cellular decision-making. Rather, cell fate choice appears to be the outcome of a ‘molecular race’ between differentiation programs that compete in time, providing a simple dynamic mechanism for decision-making.},

abstract = {The transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) and Wnt/wingless pathways play pivotal roles in tissue specification during development. Activation of Smads, the effectors of TGFbeta superfamily signals, results in Smad translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where they act as transcriptional comodulators to regulate target gene expression. Wnt/wingless signals are mediated by the DNA-binding HMG box transcription factors lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1/T cell-specific factor (LEF1/TCF) and their coactivator beta-catenin. Herein, we show that Smad3 physically interacts with the HMG box domain of LEF1 and that TGFbeta and Wnt pathways synergize to activate transcription of the Xenopus homeobox gene twin (Xtwn). Disruption of specific Smad and LEF1/TCF DNA-binding sites in the promoter abrogates synergistic activation of the promoter. Consistent with this observation, introduction of Smad sites into a TGFbeta-insensitive LEF1/TCF target gene confers cooperative TGFbeta and Wnt responsiveness to the promoter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TGFbeta-dependent activation of LEF1/TCF target genes can occur in the absence of beta-catenin binding to LEF1/TCF and requires both Smad and LEF1/TCF DNA-binding sites in the Xtwn promoter. Thus, our results show that TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways can independently or cooperatively regulate LEF1/TCF target genes and suggest a model for how these pathways can synergistically activate target genes.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt ligands function in numerous developmental processes, and alterations of both signaling pathways are associated with common pathologic conditions, including cancer. To obtain insight into the extent of interdependence of the two signaling cascades in regulating biological responses, we used an oligonucleotide microarray approach to identify Wnt and TGF-beta target genes using normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells as a model. Combination treatment of TGF-beta and Wnt revealed a novel transcriptional program that could not have been predicted from single ligand treatments and included a cohort of genes that were cooperatively induced by both pathways. These included both novel and known components or modulators of TGF-beta and Wnt pathways, suggesting that mutual feedback is a feature of the coordinated activities of the ligands. The majority of the cooperative targets display increased expression in tumors derived from either Min (many intestinal neoplasia) or mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt1 mice, two models of Wnt-induced tumors, with nine of these genes (Ankrd1, Ccnd1, Ctgf, Gpc1, Hs6st2, IL11, Inhba, Mmp14, and Robo1) showing increases in both. Reduction of TGF-beta signaling by expression of a dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor in bigenic MMTV-Wnt1/DNIIR mice increased mammary tumor latency and was correlated with a decrease in expression of Gpc1, Inhba, and Robo1, three of the TGF-beta/Wnt cooperative targets. Our results indicate that the TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are firmly intertwined and generate a unique gene expression pattern that can contribute to tumor progression.},

abstract = {The intestinal crypt-niche interaction is thought to be essential to the function, maintenance, and proliferation of progenitor stem cells found at the bases of intestinal crypts. These stem cells are constantly renewing the intestinal epithelium by sending differentiated cells from the base of the crypts of Lieberk\"{u}hn to the villus tips where they slough off into the intestinal lumen. The intestinal niche consists of various cell types, extracellular matrix, and growth factors and surrounds the intestinal progenitor cells. There have recently been advances in the understanding of the interactions that regulate the behavior of the intestinal epithelium and there is great interest in methods for isolating and expanding viable intestinal epithelium. However, there is no method to maintain primary human small intestinal epithelium in culture over a prolonged period of time. Similarly no method has been published that describes isolation and support of human intestinal epithelium in an in vivo model. We describe a technique to isolate and maintain human small intestinal epithelium in vitro from surgical specimens. We also describe a novel method to maintain human intestinal epithelium subcutaneously in a mouse model for a prolonged period of time. Our methods require various growth factors and the intimate interaction between intestinal sub-epithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and the intestinal epithelial cells to support the epithelial in vitro and in vivo growth. Absence of these myofibroblasts precluded successful maintenance of epithelial cell formation and proliferation beyond just a few days, even in the presence of supportive growth factors. We believe that the methods described here can be used to explore the molecular basis of human intestinal stem cell support, maintenance, and growth.},

Although experimental studies are beginning to reveal molecular mechanisms underlying such control, there is still very little known about the control strategies themselves. Here, we consider how secreted negative feedback factors ("chalones") may be used to control the output of multistage cell lineages, as exemplified by the actions of GDF11 and activin in a self-renewing neural tissue, the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE). We begin by specifying performance objectives-what, precisely, is being controlled, and to what degree-and go on to calculate how well different types of feedback configurations, feedback sensitivities, and tissue architectures achieve control. Ultimately, we show that many features of the OE-the number of feedback loops, the cellular processes targeted by feedback, even the location of progenitor cells within the tissue-fit with expectations for the best possible control. In so doing, we also show that certain distinctions that are commonly drawn among cells and molecules-such as whether a cell is a stem cell or transit-amplifying cell, or whether a molecule is a growth inhibitor or stimulator-may be the consequences of control, and not a reflection of intrinsic differences in cellular or molecular character.},

abstract = {Endoglin is a homodimeric membrane glycoprotein which can bind the beta 1 and beta 3 isoforms of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We reported previously that endoglin is upregulated during monocyte differentiation. We have now observed that TGF-beta itself can stimulate the expression of endoglin in cultured human monocytes and in the U-937 monocytic line. To study the functional role of endoglin, stable transfectants of U-937 cells were generated which overexpress L- or S- endoglin isoforms, differing in their cytoplasmic domain. Inhibition of cellular proliferation and downregulation of c-myc mRNA which are normally induced by TGF-beta 1 in U-937 cells were totally abrogated in L-endoglin transfectants and much reduced in the S-endoglin transfectants. Inhibition of proliferation by TGF-beta 2 was not altered in the transfectants, in agreement with the isoform specificity of endoglin. Additional responses of U-937 cells to TGF-beta 1, including stimulation of fibronectin synthesis, cellular adhesion, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) phosphorylation, and homotypic aggregation were also inhibited in the endoglin transfectants. However, modulation of integrin and PECAM-1 levels and stimulation of mRNA levels for TGF-beta 1 and its receptors R-I, R-II, and betaglycan occurred normally in the endoglin transfectants. No changes in total ligand binding were observed in L-endoglin transfectants relative to mock, while a 1.5-fold increase was seen in S-endoglin transfectants. The degradation rate of the ligand was the same in all transfectants. Elucidating the mechanism by which endoglin modulates several cellular responses to TGF-beta 1 without interfering with ligand binding or degradation should increase our understanding of the complex pathways which mediate the effects of this factor.},

abstract = {Wnt signaling plays an important role in both oncogenesis and development. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in stabilization of the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Recent studies have demonstrated that axin, which coordinates beta-catenin degradation, is itself degraded. Although the key molecules required for transducing a Wnt signal have been identified, a quantitative understanding of this pathway has been lacking. We have developed a mathematical model for the canonical Wnt pathway that describes the interactions among the core components: Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled, GSK3beta, APC, axin, beta-catenin, and TCF. Using a system of differential equations, the model incorporates the kinetics of protein-protein interactions, protein synthesis/degradation, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. We initially defined a reference state of kinetic, thermodynamic, and flux data from experiments using Xenopus extracts. Predictions based on the analysis of the reference state were used iteratively to develop a more refined model from which we analyzed the effects of prolonged and transient Wnt stimulation on beta-catenin and axin turnover. We predict several unusual features of the Wnt pathway, some of which we tested experimentally. An insight from our model, which we confirmed experimentally, is that the two scaffold proteins axin and APC promote the formation of degradation complexes in very different ways. We can also explain the importance of axin degradation in amplifying and sharpening the Wnt signal, and we show that the dependence of axin degradation on APC is an essential part of an unappreciated regulatory loop that prevents the accumulation of beta-catenin at decreased APC concentrations. By applying control analysis to our mathematical model, we demonstrate the modular design, sensitivity, and robustness of the Wnt pathway and derive an explicit expression for tumor suppression and oncogenicity.},

abstract = {In response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), NF-$\kappa$B enters the nucleus and promotes inflammatory and stress-responsive gene transcription. Because NF-$\kappa$B deregulation is associated with disease, one might expect strict control of NF-$\kappa$B localization. However, nuclear NF-$\kappa$B levels exhibit considerable cell-to-cell variability, even in unstimulated cells. To resolve this paradox and determine how transcription-inducing signals are encoded, we quantified single-cell NF-$\kappa$B translocation dynamics and transcription in the same cells. We show that TNF-induced transcription correlates best with fold change in nuclear NF-$\kappa$B, not absolute nuclear NF-$\kappa$B abundance. Using computational modeling, we find that an incoherent feedforward loop, from competition for binding to $\kappa$B motifs, could provide memory of the preligand state necessary for fold-change detection. Experimentally, we observed three gene-specific transcriptional patterns that our model recapitulates by modulating competition strength alone. Fold-change detection buffers against stochastic variation in signaling molecules and explains how cells tolerate variability in NF-$\kappa$B abundance and localization.},

abstract = {The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt/wingless pathways play critical roles in the specification of cell fate during development and also contribute to cancer formation and progression. Whereas Wnt signaling is clearly pro-oncogenic, TGF-beta signaling is cell- and context-dependent, manifesting both inhibitory and proliferative effects. The growth factor, gastrin, has previously been shown to be a downstream target of the Wnt pathway and a promoter of gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we show that the mouse gastrin promoter is regulated synergistically by TGF-beta/Smads and beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF). Co-transfection of Smad3/Smad4 and beta-catenin expression constructs synergistically activated mouse gastrin promoter activity 30-60-fold in AGS cells with minimal effect seen with either construct alone. This activation was further potentiated by TGF-beta1 treatment. Mutating either the TCF binding site or the Smad-binding element (SBE) diminished the activation of gastrin expression by Smad3/Smad4 and beta-catenin and led to a loss of gastrin promoter responsiveness to TGF-beta1 treatment. Wnt and TGF-beta regulated endogenous gastrin mRNA levels in AGS cells in a similar fashion, as revealed by small interference RNA studies or overexpression of Smads and TCF4/beta-catenin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that the putative SBE and T-cell factor (TCF) sites were able to bind a complex containing Smads and beta-catenin/TCF4. In addition, the synergy between Smads and beta-catenin/TCF4 was dependent on CREB-binding protein (CBP)/P300, as demonstrated by overexpression of CBP or E1A. Moreover, by using a heterogeneous promoter reporter system, we showed that this complex containing Smads/TCF4/beta-catenin complex was able to up-regulate transcription at isolated SBE or TCF sites. Thus, the Wnt signaling pathway is able to activate some target genes through its actions as a co-activator at non-TCF sites and has the potential to profoundly alter transcriptional responses to TGF-beta signaling.},

abstract = {Endoglin (CD105) is the target gene for the hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type I (HHT1), a dominantly inherited vascular disorder. It shares with betaglycan a limited amino acid sequence homology and being components of the membrane transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor complex. Using rat myoblasts as a model system, we found that overexpression of endoglin led to a decreased TGF-beta response to cellular growth inhibition and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 synthesis, whereas overexpression of betaglycan resulted in an enhanced response to inhibition of cellular proliferation and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 induced expression in the presence of TGF-beta. The regulation by endoglin of TGF-beta responses seems to reside on the extracellular domain, as evidenced by the functional analysis of two chimeric proteins containing different combinations of endoglin and betaglycan domains. Binding followed by cross-linking with 125I-TGF-beta1 demonstrated that betaglycan expressing cells displayed a clear increase (about 3. 5-fold), whereas endoglin expressing cells only displayed an slight increment (about 1.6-fold) in ligand binding with respect to mock transfectants. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of radiolabeled receptors demonstrated that expression of endoglin or betaglycan is associated with an increased TGF-beta binding to the signaling receptor complex; however, while endoglin increased binding to types I and II receptors, betaglycan increased the binding to the type II receptor. Conversely, we found that TGF-beta binding to endoglin required the presence of receptor type II as evidenced by transient transfections experiments in COS cells. These findings suggest a role for endoglin in TGF-beta responses distinct from that of betaglycan.},

abstract = {In response to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), Smad4 forms complexes with activated Smad2 and Smad3, which accumulate in the nucleus, where they both positively and negatively regulate TGF-beta target genes. Mutation or deletion of Smad4 is found in about 50\% of pancreatic tumors and in about 15\% of colorectal tumors. As Smad4 is a central component of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway, we have determined whether Smad4 is absolutely required for all TGF-beta responses, to evaluate the effect of its loss during human tumor development. We have generated cell lines from the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT or the pancreatic tumor cell line Colo-357, which stably express a tetracyline-inducible small interfering RNA targeted against Smad4. In response to tetracycline, Smad4 expression is effectively silenced. Large-scale microarray analysis identifies two populations of TGF-beta target genes that are distinguished by their dependency on Smad4. Some genes absolutely require Smad4 for their regulation, while others do not. Functional analysis also indicates a differential Smad4 requirement for TGF-beta-induced functions; TGF-beta-induced cell cycle arrest and migration, but not epithelial-mesenchymal transition, are abolished after silencing of Smad4. Altogether our results suggest that loss of Smad4 might promote TGF-beta-mediated tumorigenesis by abolishing tumor-suppressive functions of TGF-beta while maintaining some tumor-promoting TGF-beta responses.},

Mutant mice were born, demonstrating that N-cad can structurally replace E-cad and establish proper organ architecture. After birth, mutant mice gradually developed a mutant phenotype in both the small and large intestine and died at \~{}2-3 weeks of age, probably due to malnutrition during the transition to solid food. Molecular analysis revealed an extended domain of cells from the crypt into the villus region, with nuclear localization of beta-catenin (beta-cat; Ctnnb1) and enhanced expression of several beta-cat target genes. In addition, the BMP signaling pathway was suppressed in the intestinal epithelium of the villi, suggesting that N-cad might interfere with BMP signaling in the intestinal epithelial cell layer. Interestingly, mutant mice developed severe dysplasia and clusters of cells with neoplastic features scattered along the crypt-villus axis in the small and large intestine. Our experimental model indicates that, in the absence of E-cad, the sole expression of N-cad in an epithelial environment is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformations.},

In an effort to identify mechanisms that regulate the pro-migratory TGFbeta 'switch' in mammary epithelial cells in vitro, we found that TGFbeta stimulates the phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad5, which are typically associated with bone morphogenetic protein signalling. Mechanistically, this phosphorylation event requires the kinase activity and, unexpectedly, the L45 loop motif of the type I TGFbeta receptor, ALK5, as evidenced by studies using short hairpin RNA-resistant ALK5 mutants in ALK5-depleted cells and in vitro kinase assays. Functionally, Smad1/5 co-depletion studies demonstrate that this phosphorylation event is essential to the initiation and promotion of TGFbeta-stimulated migration. Moreover, this phosphorylation event is preferentially detected in permissive environments such as those created by tumorigenic cells or oncogene activation. Taken together, our data provide evidence that TGFbeta-stimulated Smad1/5 phosphorylation, which occurs through a non-canonical mechanism that challenges the notion of selective Smad phosphorylation by ALK5, mediates the pro-migratory TGFbeta switch in mammary epithelial cells.},

abstract = {TGF-beta signaling involves a wide array of signaling molecules and multiple controlling events. Scaffold proteins create a functional proximity of signaling molecules and control the specificity of signal transduction. While many components involved in the TGF-beta pathway have been elucidated, little is known about how those components are coordinated by scaffold proteins. Here, we show that Axin activates TGF-beta signaling by forming a multimeric complex consisting of Smad7 and ubiquitin E3 ligase Arkadia. Axin depends on Arkadia to facilitate TGF-beta signaling, as their small interfering RNAs reciprocally abolished the stimulatory effect on TGF-beta signaling. Specific knockdown of Axin or Arkadia revealed that Axin and Arkadia cooperate with each other in promoting Smad7 ubiquitination. Pulse-chase experiments further illustrated that Axin significantly decreased the half-life of Smad7. Axin also induces nuclear export of Smad7. Interestingly, Axin associates with Arkadia and Smad7 independently of TGF-beta signal, in contrast to its transient association with inactive Smad3. However, coexpression of Wnt-1 reduced Smad7 ubiquitination by downregulating Axin levels, underscoring the importance of Axin as an intrinsic regulator in TGF-beta signaling.},

abstract = {Genetic evidence from both humans and mice suggests that Wnt/beta-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are essential for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. Here we describe a mechanism through which BMPs antagonize Wnt signaling and retard bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. Treatment with Wnt3a, but not BMP-2, stimulated Lef1-mediated transcriptional activity, whereas co-stimulation with both Wnt3a and BMP-2 markedly reduced Wnt3a-induced reporter activity. Immunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells transfected with individual Smads and Wnt pathway components revealed a specific interaction between Dvl-1 and Smad1 that was dependent on the presence of Wnt3a or BMP-2. Under unstimulated conditions, Dvl-1 and Smad1 are co-immunoprecipitated and form a complex through the linker region of Smad1. Wnt3a treatment transiently disrupted the Dvl-1/Smad1 interaction coincident with nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. In contrast, when cells were exposed to both Wnt3a and BMP-2, there was an enhanced accumulation of the Dvl-1-Smad1 complex and a decreased nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Expression of a mutant Smad1 protein, which cannot be phosphorylated in response to BMP, eliminated the inhibitory effect of BMP on Wnt-inducedbeta-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activity. These results identify a potential mechanism whereby BMP-2 antagonizes Wnt signaling in osteoblast progenitors by promoting an interaction between Smad1 and Dvl-1 that restricts beta-catenin activation.},

Here we present strategies to visualize synaptic circuits by genetically labelling neurons with multiple, distinct colours. In Brainbow transgenes, Cre/lox recombination is used to create a stochastic choice of expression between three or more fluorescent proteins (XFPs). Integration of tandem Brainbow copies in transgenic mice yielded combinatorial XFP expression, and thus many colours, thereby providing a way to distinguish adjacent neurons and visualize other cellular interactions. As a demonstration, we reconstructed hundreds of neighbouring axons and multiple synaptic contacts in one small volume of a cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately 90 colours. The expression in some lines also allowed us to map glial territories and follow glial cells and neurons over time in vivo. The ability of the Brainbow system to label uniquely many individual cells within a population may facilitate the analysis of neuronal circuitry on a large scale.},

However, differentiating preadipocytes are highly heterogeneous in cellular and lipid droplet (LD) morphologies, and the degree to which individual cells follow population-averaged trends is unclear. In this study, we analyze the molecular heterogeneity of differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using immunofluorescence microscopy. Unexpectedly, we only observe a small percentage of cells with high simultaneous expression of markers for adipogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARgamma], CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, and adiponectin) and lipid accumulation (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin A, and LDs). Instead, we identify subpopulations of cells with negatively correlated expressions of these readouts. Acute perturbation of adipocyte differentiation with PPARgamma agonists, forskolin, and fatty acids induced subpopulation-specific effects, including redistribution of the percentage of cells in observed subpopulations and differential expression levels of PPARgamma. Collectively, our results suggested that heterogeneity observed during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis reflects a dynamic mixture of subpopulations with distinct physiological states.},

Then we constructed subpopulation profiles step-wise from replicate experiments, in which cells were labeled with different but overlapping marker sets. We applied our approach to identify molecular differences among subpopulations and to identify functional groupings of markers, in populations of differentiating mouse preadipocytes, polarizing human neutrophil-like cells and dividing human cancer cells.},

In colorectal cancer, activating mutations in Wnt pathway components lead to inappropriate activation of the TCF4/beta-catenin transcriptional programme and tumourigenesis. The mechanisms by which TCF4/beta-catenin activate key target genes are not well understood. Using a proteomics approach, we identified Tnik, a member of the germinal centre kinase family as a Tcf4 interactor in the proliferative crypts of mouse small intestine. Tnik is recruited to promoters of Wnt target genes in mouse crypts and in Ls174T colorectal cancer cells in a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Depletion of TNIK and expression of TNIK kinase mutants abrogated TCF-LEF transcription, highlighting the essential function of the kinase activity in Wnt target gene activation. In vitro binding and kinase assays show that TNIK directly binds both TCF4 and beta-catenin and phosphorylates TCF4. siRNA depletion of TNIK followed by expression array analysis showed that TNIK is an essential, specific activator of Wnt transcriptional programme. This kinase may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.},

abstract = {Cluster division is a critical issue in fluorescence microscopy-based analytical cytology when preparation protocols do not provide appropriate separation of objects. Overlooking clustered nuclei and analyzing only isolated nuclei may dramatically increase analysis time or affect the statistical validation of the results. Automatic segmentation of clustered nuclei requires the implementation of specific image segmentation tools. Most algorithms are inspired by one of the two following strategies: 1) cluster division by the detection of internuclei gradients; or 2) division by definition of domains of influence (geometrical approach). Both strategies lead to completely different implementations, and usually algorithms based on a single view strategy fail to correctly segment most clustered nuclei, or perform well just for a specific type of sample. An algorithm based on morphological watersheds has been implemented and tested on the segmentation of microscopic nuclei clusters. This algorithm provides a tool that can be used for the implementation of both gradient- and domain-based algorithms, and, more importantly, for the implementation of mixed (gradient- and shape-based) algorithms. Using this algorithm, almost 90\% of the test clusters were correctly segmented in peripheral blood and bone marrow preparations. The algorithm was valid for both types of samples, using the appropriate markers and transformations.},

Even though the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF$\beta$) transduction cascade is rather simple, in vivo responsiveness to TGF$\beta$ ligands is tightly regulated at several steps. As such, TGF$\beta$ represents a paradigm for how the activity of one signaling system is modulated by others. Here, we report an unsuspected regulatory step involving Dishevelled (Dvl) and Par1b (also known as MARK2). Dvl and Par1b cooperate to enable TGF$\beta$/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in Xenopus mesoderm development and TGF$\beta$ responsiveness in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, the assembly of the Par1b/Dvl3/Smad4 complex is fostered by Wnt5a. The association of Smad4 to Dvl/Par1 prevents its inhibitory ubiquitination by ectodermin (also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma or tripartite motif protein 33). We propose that this crosstalk is relevant to coordinate TGF$\beta$ responses with Wnt-noncanonical and polarity pathways.},

abstract = {The proto-oncogene Wnt-1 encodes a cysteine-rich, secretory glycoprotein implicated in virus-induced mouse mammary cancer and intercellular signaling during vertebrate neural development. To attempt to correlate structural motifs of Wnt-1 protein with its function, 12 mutations were introduced singly and in several combinations into the coding sequence of Wnt-1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant alleles in a retroviral vector were tested for their ability to transform the mouse mammary epithelial cell line C57MG in two ways: by direct infection of C57MG cells and by infection of NIH3T3 cells that serve as donors of Wnt-1 protein to adjacent C57MG cells in a secretion-dependent (paracrine) assay. In addition, the synthesis and secretion of mutant proteins were monitored in multiple cell types by immunological assays. Deletion of the signal peptide demonstrated that transformation in both direct and paracrine assays depends upon entry of Wnt-1 protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. Changes in potential proteolytic processing sites (two basic dipeptides and a probable signal peptidase cleavage site) did not adversely impair biological activity or protein processing and uncovered a second site for cleavage by signal peptidase. Replacement of each of the four asparagine-linked glycosylation sites did not affect transforming activity at normal temperatures, but one glycosylation site mutant was found to be temperature-sensitive for transformation. An allele encoding a protein that lacks all four glycosylation sites was also transformation competent. In two of four cases, substitution of serine for a cysteine residue impaired transforming activity at the usual temperature, and transformation was temperature sensitive in a third case, implying that at least some of the highly conserved cysteine residues are important for Wnt-1 function.},

In terms of cancer development, Wnt-5a has, until recently, lived in the shadow of its better-characterised relatives. This was largely because of its apparent inability to transform cells or signal through the canonical beta-catenin pathway that is so important in cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Recent work in a wide range of human tumours has pointed to a critical role for Wnt-5a in malignant progression, but there is conflicting evidence whether Wnt-5a has a tumour-promoting or -suppressing role. Emerging evidence suggests that the functions of Wnt-5a can be drastically altered depending on the availability of key receptors. Hence, the presence or absence of these receptors may go some way to explain the conflicting role of Wnt-5a in different cancers. This review summarises our current understanding of Wnt-5a and cancer.},

abstract = {Betaglycan is a coreceptor for members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Mutagenesis has identified two ligand binding regions, one at the membrane-distal and the other at the membrane-proximal half of the betaglycan ectodomain. Here we show that partial plasmin digestion of soluble betaglycan produces two proteolysis-resistant fragments of 45 and 55 kDa, consistent with the predicted secondary structure, which indicates an intervening nonstructured linker region separating the highly structured N- and C-terminal domains. Amino terminal sequencing indicates that the 45 and 55 kDa fragments correspond, respectively, to the membrane-distal and -proximal regions. Plasmin treatment of membrane betaglycan results in the production of equivalent proteolysis-resistant fragments. The 45 and 55 kDa fragments, as well as their recombinant soluble counterparts, Sol Delta10 and Sol Delta11, bind TGF-beta, but nonetheless, compared to intact soluble betaglycan, have a severely diminished ability to block TGF-beta activity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis indicates that soluble betaglycan has K(d)'s in the low nanomolar range for the three TGF-beta isoforms, while those for Sol Delta10 and Sol Delta11 are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher. SPR analysis further shows that the K(d)'s of Sol Delta11 are not changed in the presence of Sol Delta10, indicating that the high affinity of soluble betaglycan is a consequence of tethering the domains together. Overall, these results suggest that betaglycan ectodomain exhibits a bilobular structure in which each lobule folds independently and binds TGF-beta through distinct nonoverlapping interfaces and that linker modification may be an approach to improve soluble betaglycan's TGF-beta neutralizing activity.},

In BE, the stratified epithelium is replaced by an intestinal-type epithelium owing to chronic gastroduodenal reflux. Since self-renewal of intestinal crypts is driven by Notch signaling, we investigated whether this pathway was active in the proliferative crypts of BE. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of an intact and activated Notch signaling pathway in metaplastic BE epithelium, but not in the normal human esophagus. Similar observations were made in two well-known human Barrett's-derived EAC cell lines, OE33 and SKGT-5. We then sought to investigate the effects of Notch inhibition by systemic treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor in a well-validated rodent model for BE. As we have shown previously in normal intestinal epithelium, Notch inhibition converted the proliferative Barrett's epithelial cells into terminally differentiated goblet cells, whereas the squamous epithelium remained intact. These data imply that local application of gamma-secretase inhibitors may present a simple therapeutic strategy for this increasingly common pre-malignant condition.},

Using EphB2 and the ISC marker Lgr5, we have FACS-purified and profiled mouse ISCs, crypt proliferative progenitors, and late transient amplifying cells to define a gene program specific for normal ISCs. Furthermore, we discovered that ISC-specific genes identify a stem-like cell population positioned at the bottom of tumor structures reminiscent of crypts. EphB2 sorted ISC-like tumor cells display robust tumor-initiating capacity in immunodeficient mice as well as long-term self-renewal potential.

abstract = {Differentiation and specialisation of epithelial cells in the small intestine is regulated in two ways. First, there is differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestinal stem cells into absorptive enterocytes, Paneth, goblet, tuft, enteroendocrine or M-cells, which is mainly regulated by WNT. Second, there is specialization along the cephalocaudal axis with different absorptive and digestive functions in duodenum, jejunum and ileum that is controlled by several transcription factors such as GATA4. However, so far it is unknown whether location-specific functional properties are intrinsically programmed within stem cells or if continuous signalling from mesenchymal cells is necessary to maintain the location-specific identity of the small intestine. By using the pure epithelial organoid technique, we show that region-specific gene expression profiles are conserved throughout long-term cultures of both mouse and human intestinal stem cells and correlated with differential Gata4 expression. Furthermore, the human organoid culture system demonstrates that Gata4-regulated gene expression is only allowed in absence of WNT signalling. These data show that location-specific function is intrinsically programmed in the adult stem cells of the small intestine and that their differentiation fate is independent of location-specific extracellular signals. In light of the potential future clinical application of small intestine-derived organoids, our data imply that it is important to generate GATA4-positive and GATA4-negative cultures to regenerate all essential functions of the small intestine.

One way in which communication is achieved is through the secretion of signaling molecules that are received by neighboring responding cells. Wnt ligands comprise a large family of secreted, hydrophobic, glycoproteins that control a variety of developmental and adult processes in all metazoan organisms. By binding to various receptors present on receiving cells, Wnts initiate intracellular signaling cascades resulting in changes in gene transcription. Misregulation of Wnt signaling contributes to cancer and other degenerative disorders; thus, much effort has been made to understand the ways in which the pathway is controlled. Although ample research into the regulatory mechanisms that influence intracellular signaling events has proved fruitful, a great deal still remains to be elucidated regarding the mechanisms that control Wnt protein processing and secretion from cells, transport through the extracellular space, and protein reception on neighboring cells. This review attempts to consolidate the current data regarding these essential processes.},

Cross-talk creates the possibility for both specificity and versatility in signaling during development and during repair of injured tissue.

Here we report an analysis of 3,127 integration site sequences from human cells. We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV), and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors, analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines, strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV, though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration, but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites, as reported previously. ASLV vectors showed only a weak preference for active genes and no preference for transcription start regions. Thus, each of the three retroviruses studied showed unique integration site preferences, suggesting that virus-specific binding of integration complexes to chromatin features likely guides site selection.},

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) exhibit broad spectra of biological activities in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, blood vessels, heart, kidney, neurons, liver and lung. BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family that bind to type II and type I serine-threonine kinase receptors, and transduce signals through Smad and non-Smad signalling pathways. Recent findings have revealed that BMP signalling is finely tuned by various mechanisms in both positive and negative fashions. Perturbations of BMP signalling pathways are linked to a wide variety of clinical disorders, including vascular diseases, skeletal diseases and cancer. Administration of recombinant BMP ligands and increasing endogenous expression of BMPs provide therapeutic effects on some diseases. The recent development of BMP receptor inhibitors may also prove useful for some clinical diseases induced by hyperactivation of the BMP signalling pathways.},

The mammalian intestinal epithelium is well suited to approach this problem, as it is composed of well-delineated units called crypts of Lieberk\"{u}hn. We found that Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, was required for crypt regeneration after injury in mice. Unlike controls, Wnt5a-deficient mice maintained an expanded population of proliferative epithelial cells in the wound. We used an in vitro system to enrich for intestinal epithelial stem cells to discover that Wnt5a inhibited proliferation of these cells. Surprisingly, the effects of Wnt5a were mediated by activation of transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling. These findings suggest a Wnt5a-dependent mechanism for forming new crypt units to reestablish homeostasis.},

Microinjection of XTcf-3 mRNA in embryos results in nuclear translocation of $\beta$-catenin. The $\beta$-catenin–XTcf-3 complex activates transcription in a transient reporter gene assay, while XTcf-3 by itself is silent. N-terminal deletion of XTcf-3 ($\Delta$N) abrogates the interaction with $\beta$-catenin, as well as the consequent transcription activation. This dominant-negative $\Delta$N mutant suppresses the induction of axis duplication by microinjected $\beta$-catenin. It also suppresses endogenous axis specification upon injection into the dorsal blastomeres of a 4-cell-stage embryo. We propose that signaling by $\beta$-catenin involves complex formation with XTcf-3, followed by nuclear translocation and activation of specific XTcf-3 target genes.},

abstract = {During the past 10 years, it has been firmly established that Smad pathways are central mediators of signals from the receptors for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members to the nucleus. However, growing biochemical and developmental evidence supports the notion that alternative, non-Smad pathways also participate in TGF-beta signalling. Non-Smad signalling proteins have three general mechanisms by which they contribute to physiological responses to TGF-beta: (1) non-Smad signalling pathways directly modify (e.g. phosphorylate) the Smads and thus modulate the activity of the central effectors; (2) Smads directly interact and modulate the activity of other signalling proteins (e.g. kinases), thus transmitting signals to other pathways; and (3) the TGF-beta receptors directly interact with or phosphorylate non-Smad proteins, thus initiating parallel signalling that cooperates with the Smad pathway in eliciting physiological responses. Thus, non-Smad signal transducers under the control of TGF-beta provide quantitative regulation of the signalling pathway, and serve as nodes for crosstalk with other major signalling pathways, such as tyrosine kinase, G-protein-coupled or cytokine receptors.},

However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

abstract = {In biological fluorescence microscopy, image contrast is often degraded by a high background arising from out of focus regions of the specimen. This background can be greatly reduced or eliminated by several modes of thick specimen microscopy, including techniques such as 3-D deconvolution and confocal. There has been a great deal of interest and some confusion about which of these methods is 'better', in principle or in practice. The motivation for the experiments reported here is to establish some rough guidelines for choosing the most appropriate method of microscopy for a given biological specimen. The approach is to compare the efficiency of photon collection, the image contrast and the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by the different methods at equivalent illumination, using a specimen in which the amount of out of focus background is adjustable over the range encountered with biological samples. We compared spot scanning confocal, spinning disk confocal and wide-field/deconvolution (WFD) microscopes and find that the ratio of out of focus background to in-focus signal can be used to predict which method of microscopy will provide the most useful image. We also find that the precision of measurements of net fluorescence yield is very much lower than expected for all modes of microscopy. Our analysis enabled a clear, quantitative delineation of the appropriate use of different imaging modes relative to the ratio of out-of-focus background to in-focus signal, and defines an upper limit to the useful range of the three most common modes of imaging.},

abstract = {The TGF-$\beta$ and Wnt pathways are involved in cell fate and tumorigenicity. A recent report indicated that a TGF-$\beta$ target gene, TMEPAI (transmembrane prostate androgen-induced RNA), is possibly also a downstream target of Wnt signaling. Although TMEPAI was believed to be involved in tumorigenicity because of its blockage of TGF-$\beta$ signaling, how TGF-$\beta$ and Wnt signals affect the activation of the TMEPAI gene is not well understood. Herein, we show that the TMEPAI promoter is regulated synergistically by TGF-$\beta$/Smad and Wnt/$\beta$-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) 7L2. The critical cis-element for dual signals, termed TGF-$\beta$-responsive TCF7L2-binding element (TTE), is located in intron 1 of the TMEPAI gene. TCF7L2, but not Smad proteins, bound to TTE, whereas the disruption of TTE by mutagenesis remarkably counteracted both TGF-$\beta$ and TCF7L2 responses. The introduction of mutations in critical Smad-binding elements blocked the activation of the TMEPAI promoter by TCF7L2. Furthermore, our DNA-protein interaction experiments revealed the indirect binding of TCF7L2 to Smad-binding elements via Smad3 upon TGF-$\beta$ stimulation as well as its TGF-$\beta$-dependent association with TTE. We demonstrate that the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin/TCF7L2 pathway is preferentially able to alter the transcriptional regulation of the TGF-$\beta$-target gene, TMEPAI.},

abstract = {Loss of function of the Wnt co-receptor, lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, decreases bone formation, and a point mutation in this gene results in high bone mass, indicating the importance of this signaling pathway in bone formation. However, the exact mechanism is currently unknown. We examined a potential role for Wnt signaling and functional cross-talk of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in osteoblast differentiation. To assess the contribution of Wnt, we generated C2C12 cells over-expressing Wnt3a or Wnt5a and treated these with BMP-2. We showed that expression of matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein was induced by BMP-2 in Wnt3a over-expressing C2C12 cells but not in Wnt5a over-expressing C2C12 cells. Over-expression of Wnt3a blocked BMP-2-induced inhibition of myotube formation in C2C12 cells when switched to low mitogen medium. In these cultures, expression of inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (Id) 1, a helix-loop-helix protein induced by BMP-2, decreased in stable Wnt3a- but not in Wnt5a-expressing cells. This suppression is mediated by a GC-rich region of the BMP-2-responsive element of the Id1 gene promoter, and interaction between Smad1/4 and beta-catenin is crucial for Wnt-mediated suppression of the BMP-2 response in C2C12 cells. Over-expression of the inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, Dickkopf, inhibits this suppression. In contrast, BMP-2 or Smad1/4 up-regulated Wnt3a or activated beta-catenin-induced lymphoid-enhancing factor 1/T cell factor-dependent transcriptional activity. These findings identify functional cross-talk of Id1 expression between Wnt and BMP signaling and demonstrate a novel mechanism for Wnt regulation of the BMP-2 response, linking Id1 expression to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.},

Cross-talk between pathways provides for complex non-linear responses to combinations of stimuli, but little is known about the density of these interactions in any specific cell. Here, we have analysed a large-scale survey of pathway interactions carried out by the Alliance for Cellular Signalling (AfCS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Twenty-two receptor-specific ligands were studied, both alone and in all pairwise combinations, for Ca2+ mobilization, cAMP synthesis, phosphorylation of many signalling proteins and for cytokine production. A large number of non-additive interactions are evident that are consistent with known mechanisms of cross-talk between pathways, but many novel interactions are also revealed. A global analysis of cross-talk suggests that many external stimuli converge on a relatively small number of interaction mechanisms to provide for context-dependent signalling.},

abstract = {Despite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community.},

abstract = {The dynamic reorganization of chromatin into rigid and compact mitotic chromosomes is of fundamental importance for faithful chromosome segregation. Owing to the difficulty of investigating this process under physiological conditions, the exact morphological transitions and the molecular machinery driving chromosome condensation remain poorly defined. Here, we review how imaging-based methods can be used to quantitate chromosome condensation in vivo, focusing on yeast and animal tissue culture cells as widely used model systems. We discuss approaches how to address structural dynamics of condensing chromosomes and chromosome segments, as well as to probe for mechanical properties of mitotic chromosomes. Application of such methods to systematic perturbation studies will provide a means to reveal the molecular networks underlying the regulation of mitotic chromosome condensation.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling leads to phosphorylation and activation of receptor-regulated Smad2 and Smad3, which form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus. The Smads, however, do not seem to reside statically in the cytoplasm in the absence of signalling or in the nucleus upon TGF-beta stimulation, but have been suggested to shuttle continuously between these cellular compartments in both the absence and presence of TGF-beta. Here we investigate this nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in detail in living cells using fusions of Smad2 and Smad4 with enhanced GFP. We first establish that the GFPSmad fusions behave like wild-type Smads in a variety of cellular assays. We go on to demonstrate directly, using photobleaching experiments, that Smad2 and Smad4 shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus in both TGF-beta-induced cells and in uninduced cells. In uninduced cells, GFPSmad2 is less mobile in the cytoplasm than is GFPSmad4, suggesting that it may be tethered there. In addition, we show that both GFPSmad2 and GFPSmad4 undergo a substantial decrease in mobility in the nucleus upon TGF-beta stimulation, suggesting that active complexes of Smads are tethered in the nucleus, whereas unactivated Smads are more freely diffusible. We propose that regulated cytoplasmic and nuclear retention may play a role in determining the distribution of Smads between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in both uninduced cells and upon TGF-beta induction.},

@article{Njoh2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report on the potential DNA binding modes and spectral characteristics of the cell-permeant far red fluorescent DNA dye, DRAQ5, in solution and bound within intact cells. Our aim was to determine the constraints for its use in flow cytometry and bioimaging.

METHODS: Solution characteristics and quantum yields were determined by spectroscopy. DRAQ5 binding to nuclear DNA was analyzed using fluorescence quenching of Hoechst 33342 dye, emission profiling by flow cytometry, and spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy of the complex DRAQ5 emission spectrum. Cell cycle profiling utilized an EGFP-cyclin B1 reporter as an independent marker of cell age. Molecular modeling was used to explore the modes of DNA binding.

RESULTS: DRAQ5 showed a low quantum yield in solution and a spectral shift upon DNA binding, but no significant fluorescence enhancement. DRAQ5 caused a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of Hoechst 33342 in live cells prelabeled with the UV excitable dye, consistent with molecular modeling that suggests AT preference and an engagement of the minor groove. In vivo spectral analysis of DRAQ5 demonstrated shifts to longer wavelengths upon binding with DNA. Analysis of spectral windows of the dual emission peaks at 681 and 707 nm in cells showed that cell cycle compartment recognition was independent of the far red-near IR emission wavelengths monitored.

CONCLUSIONS: The study provides new clues to modes of DNA binding of the modified anthraquinone molecule in vivo, and its AT base-pair selectivity. The combination of low quantum yield but high DNA affinity explains the favorable signal-to-noise profile of DRAQ5-nuclear fluorescence. The robust nature of cell cycle reporting using DRAQ5, even when restricted spectral windows are selected, facilitates the analysis of encroaching spectral emissions from other fluorescent reporters, including GFP-tagged proteins.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) receptor kinase inhibitors have a great therapeutic potential. SB431542 is one of the mainly used kinase inhibitors of the TGF$\beta$/Activin pathway receptors, but needs improvement of its EC(50) (EC(50)=1 $\mu$M) to be translated to clinical use. A key feature of SB431542 is that it specifically targets receptors from the TGF$\beta$/Activin pathway but not the closely related receptors from the bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) pathway. To understand the mechanisms of this selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of the TGF$\beta$ type I receptor (T$\beta$RI) kinase domain in complex with SB431542. We mutated T$\beta$RI residues coordinating SB431542 to their counterparts in activin-receptor like kinase 2 (ALK2), a BMP receptor kinase, and tested the kinase activity of mutated T$\beta$RI. We discovered that a Ser280Thr mutation yielded a T$\beta$RI variant that was resistant to SB431542 inhibition. Furthermore, the corresponding Thr283Ser mutation in ALK2 yielded a BMP receptor sensitive to SB431542. This demonstrated that Ser280 is the key determinant of selectivity for SB431542. This work provides a framework for optimising the SB431542 scaffold to more potent and selective inhibitors of the TGF$\beta$/Activin pathway.},

The primary concern in all forms of microscopy is the generation of contrast; for fluorescence microscopy contrast can be thought of as the difference in intensity between the cell and background, the signal-to-noise ratio. High information-content images can be formed by enhancing the signal, suppressing the noise, or both. As improved tools, such as ICCD and EMCCD cameras, become available for fluorescence imaging in molecular and cellular immunology, it is important to optimize other aspects of the imaging system. Numerous practical strategies to enhance fluorescence microscopy experiments are reviewed. The use of instrumentation such as light traps, cameras, objectives, improved fluorescent labels, and image filtration routines applicable to low light level experiments are discussed. New methodologies providing resolution well beyond that given by the Rayleigh criterion are outlined. Ongoing and future developments in fluorescence microscopy instrumentation and technique are reviewed. This review is intended to address situations where the signal is weak, which is important for emerging techniques stressing super-resolution or live cell dynamics, but is less important for conventional applications such as indirect immunofluorescence. This review provides a broad integrative discussion of fluorescence microscopy with selected applications in immunology.},

abstract = {Smad4 plays a pivotal role in all transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways. Here we describe six widely expressed alternatively spliced variants of human Smad4 with deletions of different exons in the linker, the region of Smad4 that separates the two well-conserved MH1 and MH2 domains. All these Smad4 variants form complexes with activated Smad2 and Smad3 and are incorporated into DNA-binding complexes with the transcription factor Fast-1, regardless of the amount of linker they contain. However, sequences encoded by exons 5 to 7 in the linker are essential for transcriptional activation. Most importantly, our observation that different Smad4 isoforms have different subcellular localizations has led us to the identification of a functional CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal in the Smad4 linker and a constitutively active nuclear localization signal in the N-terminal MH1 domain. In the absence of TGF-beta signaling, we conclude that Smad4 is rapidly and continuously shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the distribution of Smad4 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm being dictated by the relative strengths of the nuclear import and export signals. We demonstrate that inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export by treatment of cells with leptomycin B results in endogenous Smad4 accumulating very rapidly in the nucleus. Endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 are completely unaffected by leptomycin B treatment, indicating that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is specific for Smad4. We propose that, upon TGF-beta signaling, complex formation between Smad4 and activated Smad2 or -3 leads to nuclear accumulation of Smad4 through inhibition of its nuclear export. We demonstrate that after prolonged TGF-beta signaling Smad2 becomes dephosphorylated and Smad2 and Smad4 accumulate back in the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {Several mechanisms underlying tumor progression have remained elusive, particularly in relation to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$). Although TGF-$\beta$ initially inhibits epithelial growth, it appears to promote the progression of advanced tumors. Defects in normal TGF-$\beta$ pathways partially explain this paradox, which can lead to a cascade of downstream events that drive multiple oncogenic pathways, manifesting as several key features of tumorigenesis (uncontrolled proliferation, loss of apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, sustained angiogenesis, evasion of immune surveillance, and metastasis). Understanding the mechanisms of TGF-$\beta$ dysregulation will likely reveal novel points of convergence between TGF-$\beta$ and other pathways that can be specifically targeted for therapy.},

abstract = {Synthesis of fibronectin in an epithelial cell line (IEC-6) established from rat small intestine was demonstrated by using immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay, and collagen-binding. Internally labeled radioactive fibronectin isolated from the IEC-6 cells gave a single main band in sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Fibronectin isolated from rat plasma gave two closely spaced bands. The slower one had the same mobility as the epithelial cell fibronectin. The distribution of fibronectin in IEC-6 cells as detected by immunofluorescence was different from that described for fibroblasts and other cell types; fibronectin was present exclusively in regions of cell-to-cell contact. No fluorescence was detected on the surface membrane facing the culture medium or underneath the cells. This suggests that fibronectin may not be involved in the adhesion of the epithelial cells to the growth surface but could mediate cell-to-cell contacts. In microscopic sections of the small intestine, immunofluorescent staining with antifibronectin serum was strong in the basement membrane underlying the epithelial cells in the crypts. The in vitro synthesis of fibronectin by the crypt cells and its abundant presence in the basement membrane underlying the same cells in vivo suggests that fibronectin is a structural component of the basement membrane, and that it may be, at least in part, synthesized and deposited by the intestinal epithelium.},

We demonstrate alignment of mitotic spindles perpendicular to the apical surface specifically in the stem cell compartments of mouse and human intestine and colon. This orientation correlates with the asymmetric retention of label-retaining DNA. Both the preference for perpendicular spindle alignment and asymmetric label retention are lost in precancerous tissue heterozygous for the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor (Apc). This loss correlates with cell shape changes specifically in the stem cell compartment. Our data suggest that loss of asymmetric division in stem cells might contribute to the oncogenic effect of Apc mutations in gut epithelium.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 are 25-kDa homodimeric polypeptides that play crucial nonoverlapping roles in embryogenesis, tissue development, carcinogenesis, and immune regulation. Here we report the 3.0-A resolution crystal structure of the ternary complex between human TGF-beta1 and the extracellular domains of its type I and type II receptors, TbetaRI and TbetaRII. The TGF-beta1 ternary complex structure is similar to previously reported TGF-beta3 complex except with a 10 degrees rotation in TbetaRI docking orientation. Quantitative binding studies showed distinct kinetics between the receptors and the isoforms of TGF-beta. TbetaRI showed significant binding to TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 but not TGF-beta1, and the binding to all three isoforms of TGF-beta was enhanced considerably in the presence of TbetaRII. The preference of TGF-beta2 to TbetaRI suggests a variation in its receptor recruitment in vivo. Although TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3 bind and assemble their ternary complexes in a similar manner, their structural differences together with differences in the affinities and kinetics of their receptor binding may underlie their unique biological activities. Structural comparisons revealed that the receptor-ligand pairing in the TGF-beta superfamily is dictated by unique insertions, deletions, and disulfide bonds rather than amino acid conservation at the interface. The binding mode of TbetaRII on TGF-beta is unique to TGF-betas, whereas that of type II receptor for bone morphogenetic protein on bone morphogenetic protein appears common to all other cytokines in the superfamily. Further, extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are present at the high affinity cytokine-receptor interfaces, whereas hydrophobic interactions dominate the low affinity receptor-ligand interfaces.},

abstract = {Wingless, the Drosophila homologue of the proto-oncogene Wnt-1, encodes a secreted glycoprotein that regulates differentiation and proliferation of nearby cells. Here we report on the biochemical mechanism(s) by which the wingless signal is transmitted from cell to cell. When expressed in S2 cells, the majority (approximately 83\%) of secreted wingless protein (WG) is bound to the cell surface and extracellular matrix through specific, noncovalent interactions. The tethered WG can be released by addition of exogenous heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. WG also binds directly to heparin agarose beads with high affinity. These data suggest that WG can bind to the cell surface via naturally occurring sulfated proteoglycans. Two lines of evidence indicate that extracellular glycosaminoglycans on the receiving cells also play a functional role in WG signaling. First, treatment of WG-responsive cells with glycosaminoglycan lyases reduced WG activity by 50\%. Second, when WG-responsive cells were preincubated with 1 mM chlorate, which blocks sulfation, WG activity was inhibited to near-basal levels. Addition of exogenous heparin to the chlorate-treated cells was able to restore WG activity. Based on these results, we propose that WG belongs to the group of growth factor ligands whose actions are mediated by extracellular proteoglycan molecules.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A defining characteristic of the human intestinal epithelium is that it is the most rapidly renewing tissue in the body. However, the processes underlying tissue renewal and the mechanisms that govern their coordination have proved difficult to study in the human gut.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulation of stem cell-driven tissue renewal by canonical Wnt and TGF$\beta$/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways in the native human colonic epithelium.

DESIGN: Intact human colonic crypts were isolated from mucosal tissue samples and placed into 3D culture conditions optimised for steady-state tissue renewal. High affinity mRNA in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were complemented by functional genomic and bioimaging techniques. The effects of signalling pathway modulators on the status of intestinal stem cell biology, crypt cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and shedding were determined.

RESULTS: Native human colonic crypts exhibited distinct activation profiles for canonical Wnt, TGF$\beta$ and BMP pathways. A population of intestinal LGR5/OLFM4-positive stem/progenitor cells were interspersed between goblet-like cells within the crypt-base. Exogenous and crypt cell-autonomous canonical Wnt signals supported homeostatic intestinal stem/progenitor cell proliferation and were antagonised by TGF$\beta$ or BMP pathway activation. Reduced Wnt stimulation impeded crypt cell proliferation, but crypt cell migration and shedding from the crypt surface were unaffected and resulted in diminished crypts.

CONCLUSIONS: Steady-state tissue renewal in the native human colonic epithelium is dependent on canonical Wnt signals combined with suppressed TGF$\beta$/BMP pathways. Stem/progenitor cell proliferation is uncoupled from crypt cell migration and shedding, and is required to constantly replenish the crypt cell population.},

Due to the biochemical nature of cellular signal transduction networks, molecular noise will inevitably limit the fidelity of any messages received and processed by a cell's signal transduction networks, leaving it with an imperfect impression of its environment. Fortunately, Shannon's information theory provides a mathematical framework independent of network complexity that can quantify the amount of information that can be transmitted despite biochemical noise. In particular, the channel capacity can be used to measure the maximum number of stimuli a cell can distinguish based upon the noisy responses of its signaling systems. Here, we provide a primer for quantitative biologists that covers fundamental concepts of information theory, highlights several key considerations when experimentally measuring channel capacity, and describes successful examples of the application of information theoretic analysis to biological signaling.},

abstract = {Homeostasis in adult tissue is maintained by the activity of a minor population of long-lived resident stem cells. These adult stem cells are defined by two essential attributes, self-renewal and multipotency, and their physiological activity is regulated by a specialized microenvironment, the stem cell niche. These adult stem cells are generally considered to divide infrequently, and cell expansion is mainly achieved through the rapid proliferation of transit amplifying progenitors before they undergo terminal differentiation. Organs that operate in abrasive environments, such as the mucosa of the skin, intestine, and stomach, display a higher tissue turnover rate, which consequently places them at higher risk of developing cancer. Indeed, colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide, with over a million new cases every year. Our understanding of stem cell function in tissue homeostasis and their potential role in cancer development has been greatly hampered by the lack of reliable specific biomarkers, but recent discoveries of membrane bound biomarkers promise great progress in the field. Here we review the current advances toward identifying the stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract and in understanding their microenvironmental regulation, and also discuss their implications for human cancer.

abstract = {Wnt signaling plays key roles in development and disease. The tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is an essential negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Its best-characterized role is as part of the destruction complex, targeting the Wnt effector \ss-catenin for phosphorylation and ultimate destruction, but several studies suggested APC also may act in the nucleus at promoters of Wnt-responsive genes or to shuttle \ss-catenin out for destruction. Even in its role in the destruction complex, APC's mechanism of action remains mysterious. We have suggested APC positions the destruction complex at the appropriate subcellular location, facilitating \ss-catenin destruction. Here we directly test APC's proposed roles in the nucleus or in precisely localizing the destruction complex, by generating a series of APC2 variants to which we added tags relocalizing otherwise wild-type APC to different cytoplasmic locations. We tested these for function in human colon cancer cells and Drosophila embryos. Strikingly, all rescue Wnt regulation and down-regulate Wnt target genes in colon cancer cells, and most restore Wnt regulation in Drosophila embryos null for both fly APCs. These data suggest APC2 does not have to shuttle into the nucleus or localize to a particular subcellular location to regulate Wnt signaling.},

Evidence indicates that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt proteins regulate several steps of skeletal development. Here, we provide a molecular description of the cooperative effects of BMP and Wnt canonical pathway on the expression of the early osteogenic genes Dlx5, Msx2, and Runx2 in C2C12 cells, primary cultures of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells, and organotypic calvarial cultures. Coordinated regulation of these genes leads to the cooperative activation of their downstream osteogenic target gene osterix. Induction of these genes is mediated through enhancer regions with an evolutionary conserved structure encompassing both Smad and TCF/LEF1 DNA-binding sites. Formation of a cooperative complex is mediated through DNA binding of Smads and TCF4/$\beta$-catenin to their cognate sequences, as well as protein-protein interactions between them. The formation of these cooperative transcriptional complexes results in a more efficient recruitment of coactivators such as p300. We propose that evolutionary conserved regulatory regions in specific osteogenic master genes are key integrative modules during osteogenesis.},

abstract = {The vast majority of microscopic data in biology of the cell nucleus is currently collected using fluorescence microscopy, and most of these data are subsequently subjected to quantitative analysis. The analysis process unites a number of steps, from image acquisition to statistics, and at each of these steps decisions must be made that may crucially affect the conclusions of the whole study. This often presents a really serious problem because the researcher is typically a biologist, while the decisions to be taken require expertise in the fields of physics, computer image analysis, and statistics. The researcher has to choose between multiple options for data collection, numerous programs for preprocessing and processing of images, and a number of statistical approaches. Written for biologists, this article discusses some of the typical problems and errors that should be avoided. The article was prepared by a team uniting expertise in biology, microscopy, image analysis, and statistics. It considers the options a researcher has at the stages of data acquisition (choice of the microscope and acquisition settings), preprocessing (filtering, intensity normalization, deconvolution), image processing (radial distribution, clustering, co-localization, shape and orientation of objects), and statistical analysis.},

In order to address this problem, as well as to identify modulators of biological states in the absence of knowing the protein target of the state switch, alternative phenotypic screening approaches, such as gene expression-based and high-content imaging, have been developed. With this renewed interest in phenotypic screening, however, comes the challenge of identifying the binding protein target(s) of small-molecule hits. Emerging technologies have the potential to improve the process of target identification. In this review, we discuss the application of genomic (gene expression-based), genetic (short hairpin RNA and open reading frame screening), and proteomic approaches to protein target identification.},

abstract = {Canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin (cWnt) signaling regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to enhance bone formation. We previously reported that osteogenic action of $\beta$-catenin is dependent on BMP signaling. Here, we further examined interactions between cWnt and BMP in bone. In osteoprogenitors stimulated with BMP2, $\beta$-catenin localizes to the nucleus, physically interacts with Smad4, and is recruited to DNA-binding transcription complexes containing Smad4, R-Smads1/5, and TCF4. Furthermore, Tcf/Lef-dependent transcription, Ccnd1 expression, and proliferation all increase when Smad4, 1, or 5 levels are low, whereas TCF/Lef activities decrease when Smad4 expression is high. The ability of Smad4 to antagonize transcription of Ccnd1 is dependent on DNA-binding activity; Smad4-dependent transcription is not required. In mice, conditional deletion of Smad4 in Osterix(+) cells increases mitosis of cells on trabecular bone surfaces as well as in primary osteoblast cultures from adult bone marrow and neonatal calvaria. By contrast, ablation of Smad4 delays differentiation and matrix mineralization by primary osteoblasts in response to Wnt3a, indicating that loss of Smad4 perturbs the balance between proliferation and differentiation in osteoprogenitors. We propose that Smad4 and Tcf/Lef transcription complexes compete for $\beta$-catenin, thus restraining Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-dependent proliferative signals while favoring the matrix synthesizing activity of osteoblasts.},

abstract = {In individual cells, transcription is a random process obeying single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty, intermittent manner. The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or "noise" in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios-namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics-may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

abstract = {The APC gene encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor protein, germline mutation of which characterizes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal intestinal cancer syndrome. Inactivation of APC is also recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers, and its loss results in constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex. The proto-oncogene c-MYC has been identified as a target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer cells in vitro, in normal crypts in vivo and in intestinal epithelial cells acutely transformed on in vivo deletion of the APC gene; however, the significance of this is unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the role Myc has in the intestine after Apc loss, we have simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the adult murine small intestine. Here we show that loss of Myc rescued the phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin. Array analysis revealed that Myc is required for the majority of Wnt target gene activation following Apc loss. These data establish Myc as the critical mediator of the early stages of neoplasia following Apc loss.},

abstract = {Human and mouse embryonic stem cells (HESCs and MESCs, respectively) self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the ability to generate all three germ-layer derivatives. Despite the importance of ESCs in developmental biology and their potential impact on tissue replacement therapy, the molecular mechanism underlying ESC self-renewal is poorly understood. Here we show that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is sufficient to maintain self-renewal of both HESCs and MESCs. Although Stat-3 signaling is involved in MESC self-renewal, stimulation of this pathway does not support self-renewal of HESCs. Instead we find that Wnt pathway activation by 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), maintains the undifferentiated phenotype in both types of ESCs and sustains expression of the pluripotent state-specific transcription factors Oct-3/4, Rex-1 and Nanog. Wnt signaling is endogenously activated in undifferentiated MESCs and is downregulated upon differentiation. In addition, BIO-mediated Wnt activation is functionally reversible, as withdrawal of the compound leads to normal multidifferentiation programs in both HESCs and MESCs. These results suggest that the use of GSK-3-specific inhibitors such as BIO may have practical applications in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS:: We previously established long-term culture conditions under which single crypts or stem cells derived from mouse small intestine expand over long periods of time. The expanding crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events, simultaneously generating villus-like epithelial domains that contain all differentiated types of cells. We have adapted the culture conditions to grow similar epithelial organoids from mouse colon and human small intestine and colon. METHODS:: Based on the mouse small intestinal culture system, we optimized the mouse and human colon culture systems. RESULTS:: Addition of Wnt3A to the combination of growth factors applied to mouse colon crypts allowed them to expand indefinitely. Addition of nicotinamide,along with a small-molecule inhibitor of Alk and an inhibitor of p38, were required for long-term culture of human small intestine and colon tissues. The culture system also allowed growth of mouse Apc-deficient adenomas, human colorectal cancer cells, and human metaplastic epithelia from regions of Barrett's esophagus. CONCLUSION:: We developed a technology that can be used to study infected, inflammatory, or neoplastic tissues from the human gastrointestinal tract. These tools might have applications in regenerative biology, though ex vivo expansion of the intestinal epithelia. Studies of these cultures indicate that there is no inherent restriction in the replicative potential of adult stem cells (or a Hayflick limit) ex vivo.},

abstract = {Homeostasis of self-renewing small intestinal crypts results from neutral competition between Lgr5 stem cells, which are small cycling cells located at crypt bottoms. Lgr5 stem cells are interspersed between terminally differentiated Paneth cells that are known to produce bactericidal products such as lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins. Single Lgr5-expressing stem cells can be cultured to form long-lived, self-organizing crypt-villus organoids in the absence of non-epithelial niche cells. Here we find a close physical association of Lgr5 stem cells with Paneth cells in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. CD24(+) Paneth cells express EGF, TGF-$\alpha$, Wnt3 and the Notch ligand Dll4, all essential signals for stem-cell maintenance in culture. Co-culturing of sorted stem cells with Paneth cells markedly improves organoid formation. This Paneth cell requirement can be substituted by a pulse of exogenous Wnt. Genetic removal of Paneth cells in vivo results in the concomitant loss of Lgr5 stem cells. In colon crypts, CD24(+) cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents. We conclude that Lgr5 stem cells compete for essential niche signals provided by a specialized daughter cell, the Paneth cell.},

This change was not triggered by specific events or decisions but reflects the explosive 'knee' in the exponential growth that science has sustained during the past three-and-a-half centuries. Coming to terms with the demands and benefits of 'Big Science' is a major challenge for today's scientific generation. Since its foundation 50 years ago, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) has been of invaluable help in meeting this challenge.},

abstract = {Somatic cells have been proposed to be limited in the number of cell divisions they can undergo. This is thought to be a mechanism by which stem cells retain their integrity preventing disease. However, we have recently discovered intestinal crypt stem cells that persist for the lifetime of a mouse, yet divide every day. We now demonstrate biochemically that primary isolated Lgr5+ve stem cells contain significant telomerase activity. Telomerase activity rapidly decreases in the undifferentiated progeny of these stem cells and is entirely lost in differentiated villus cells. Conversely, asymmetric segregation of chromosomes has been proposed as a mechanism for stem cells to protect their genomes against damage. We determined the average cell cycle length of Lgr5+ve stem cells at 21.5 h and find that Lgr5+ve intestinal stem cells randomly segregate newly synthesized DNA strands, opposing the 'immortal strand' hypothesis.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that the epithelium of each adult intestinal crypt in chimaeric mice is derived from a single progenitor cell. Whether the crypts are monoclonal from the outset-that is, are formed by the proliferation of a single cell-or whether their formation is initiated by several cells was not known. Here we report that many crypts contain cells of both chimaeric genotypes in the neonatal period indicating a polyclonal origin at this stage of morphogenesis. The cellular organization of the early neonatal crypt is therefore different from that of the adult crypt, which includes a zone of 'anchored' stem cells above the crypt base. Within 2 weeks, however, the crypt progenitor cell and its descendants displace all other cells from the crypt and the crypt attains monoclonality. The distribution of enterocytes on chimaeric villi in the neonate shows a mottled pattern of mosaicism which is progressively replaced by coherent sheets of cells from the crypts, and within two weeks the orderly adult clonal pattern is established.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants are used in many studies to determine the subcellular localization of other proteins by analyzing fusion proteins. The main problem for nuclear localization studies is the fact that, to some extent, GFP translocates to the nucleus on its own. Because the nuclear import could be due to unspecific diffusion of the relatively small GFP through the nuclear pores, we analyzed the localization of multimers of a GFP variant, the enhanced GFP (EGFP). By detecting the fluorescence of the expressed proteins in gels after nonreducing SDS–PAGE, we demonstrate the integrity of the expressed proteins. Nevertheless, even EGFP homotetramers and homohexamers are found in the nuclei of the five analyzed mammalian cell lines. The use of fusion constructs of small proteins with multimeric EGFP alone, therefore, is not adequate to prove nuclear import processes. Fusion to tetrameric EGFP in combination with a careful quantification of the fluorescence intensities in the nucleus and cytoplasm might be sufficient in many cases to identify a significant difference between the fusion protein and tetrameric EGFP alone to deduce a nuclear localization signal.},

abstract = {Wnt5a is a member of the Wingless-related/MMTV-integration family of secreted growth factors, which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Wnt signaling can be broadly divided into two categories the canonical, \ss-catenin-dependent pathway and the non-canonical \ss-catenin-independent pathway. Wnt5a is a non-canonical signaling member of the Wnt family. Loss of Wnt5a is associated with early relapse of invasive breast cancer, increased metastasis, and poor survival in humans. It has been shown that TGF-\ss directly regulates expression of Wnt5a in mammary gland and that Wnt5a mediates the effects of TGF-\ss on branching during mammary gland development. Here we review the evidence suggesting Wnt5a acts as an effector of TGF-\ss actions in breast cancer. It is suggested that the tumor suppressive functions of TGF-\ss involve Wnt5a-mediated antagonism of Wnt/\ss-catenin signaling and limiting the stem cell population. Interactions between TGF-\ss and Wnt5a in metastasis appear to be more complex, and may depend on specific cues from the microenvironment as well as activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways.},

Here we demonstrate in the chicken embryo that WNT protein is not secreted to act at a distance, but rather loaded onto migrating neural crest cells that deliver it to somites. Inhibiting neural crest migration or ablating their population has a profound impact on the WNT response in somites. Furthermore, we show that a central player in the efficient delivery of WNT to somites is the heparan sulfate proteoglycan GPC4, expressed by neural crest. Together, our data describe a novel mode of signaling whereby WNT proteins hitch a ride on migratory neural crest cells to pattern the somites at a distance from its source.},

Most hematopoietic growth factors act selectively as survival factors, rather than instructively as lineage determination signals. In the neural crest, neuregulin instructively promotes gliogenesis, but how alternative fates are determined is unclear. We demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) induces the basic-helix-loop-helix protein MASH1 and neurogenesis in neural crest stem cells. In vivo, MASH1+ cells are located near sites of BMP2 mRNA expression. Some smooth muscle differentiation is also observed in BMP2. A related factor, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), exclusively promotes smooth muscle differentiation. Like neuregulin, BMP2 and TGFbeta1 act instructively rather than selectively. The neural crest and hematopoietic systems may therefore utilize growth factors in different ways to generate cellular diversity.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$ is stored in the extracellular matrix as a latent complex with its prodomain. Activation of TGF-$\beta$1 requires the binding of $\alpha$(v) integrin to an RGD sequence in the prodomain and exertion of force on this domain, which is held in the extracellular matrix by latent TGF-$\beta$ binding proteins. Crystals of dimeric porcine proTGF-$\beta$1 reveal a ring-shaped complex, a novel fold for the prodomain, and show how the prodomain shields the growth factor from recognition by receptors and alters its conformation. Complex formation between $\alpha$(v)$\beta$(6) integrin and the prodomain is insufficient for TGF-$\beta$1 release. Force-dependent activation requires unfastening of a 'straitjacket' that encircles each growth-factor monomer at a position that can be locked by a disulphide bond. Sequences of all 33 TGF-$\beta$ family members indicate a similar prodomain fold. The structure provides insights into the regulation of a family of growth and differentiation factors of fundamental importance in morphogenesis and homeostasis.},

abstract = {Accumulation of the beta-catenin protein and transactivation of a certain set of T-cell factor (TCF)-4 target genes by accumulated beta-catenin have been considered crucial in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the present review, we summarize nuclear proteins that interact with, and regulate, the beta-catenin and TCF and lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcriptional complexes. Our recent series of proteomic studies has also revealed that various classes of nuclear proteins participate in the beta-catenin-TCF-4 complex and modulate its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the protein composition of the TCF-4-containing nuclear complex is not fixed, but is regulated dynamically by endogenous programs associated with intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and exogenous stimuli. Restoration of the loss-of-function mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in colorectal cancer cells does not seem to be a realistic approach with currently available medical technologies, and only signaling molecules downstream of the APC gene product can be considered as targets of pharmacological intervention. Nuclear proteins associated with the beta-catenin-TCF-4 complex may include feasible targets for molecular therapy against colorectal cancer. Recently, an inhibitor of the interaction between CREB-binding protein and beta-catenin was shown to efficiently shut down the transcriptional activity of TCF-4 and induce apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. We also summarize current strategies in the development of drugs against Wnt signaling.},

abstract = {Cellular development, morphology and function are governed by precise patterns of gene expression. These are established by the coordinated action of genomic regulatory elements known as enhancers or cis-regulatory modules. More than 30 years after the initial discovery of enhancers, many of their properties have been elucidated; however, despite major efforts, we only have an incomplete picture of enhancers in animal genomes. In this Review, we discuss how properties of enhancer sequences and chromatin are used to predict enhancers in genome-wide studies. We also cover recently developed high-throughput methods that allow the direct testing and identification of enhancers on the basis of their activity. Finally, we discuss recent technological advances and current challenges in the field of regulatory genomics.},

abstract = {The most important product of the sequencing of a genome is a complete, accurate catalogue of genes and their products, primarily messenger RNA transcripts and their cognate proteins. Such a catalogue cannot be constructed by computational annotation alone; it requires experimental validation on a genome scale. Using 'exon' and 'tiling' arrays fabricated by ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesis, we devised an experimental approach to validate and refine computational gene predictions and define full-length transcripts on the basis of co-regulated expression of their exons. These methods can provide more accurate gene numbers and allow the detection of mRNA splice variants and identification of the tissue- and disease-specific conditions under which genes are expressed. We apply our technique to chromosome 22q under 69 experimental condition pairs, and to the entire human genome under two experimental conditions. We discuss implications for more comprehensive, consistent and reliable genome annotation, more efficient, full-length complementary DNA cloning strategies and application to complex diseases.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that certain cellular sensory systems display fold-change detection (FCD): a response whose entire shape, including amplitude and duration, depends only on fold changes in input and not on absolute levels. Thus, a step change in input from, for example, level 1 to 2 gives precisely the same dynamical output as a step from level 2 to 4, because the steps have the same fold change. We ask what the benefit of FCD is and show that FCD is necessary and sufficient for sensory search to be independent of multiplying the input field by a scalar. Thus, the FCD search pattern depends only on the spatial profile of the input and not on its amplitude. Such scalar symmetry occurs in a wide range of sensory inputs, such as source strength multiplying diffusing/convecting chemical fields sensed in chemotaxis, ambient light multiplying the contrast field in vision, and protein concentrations multiplying the output in cellular signaling systems. Furthermore, we show that FCD entails two features found across sensory systems, exact adaptation and Weber's law, but that these two features are not sufficient for FCD. Finally, we present a wide class of mechanisms that have FCD, including certain nonlinear feedback and feed-forward loops. We find that bacterial chemotaxis displays feedback within the present class and hence, is expected to show FCD. This can explain experiments in which chemotaxis searches are insensitive to attractant source levels. This study, thus, suggests a connection between properties of biological sensory systems and scalar symmetry stemming from physical properties of their input fields.},

abstract = {Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play an important role during organ development and during regeneration after tissue damage. BMPs signal via transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. From our current understanding heteromeric complexes of type I and type II receptors are required for signal propagation. Presently, three type I and three type II receptors are known to bind BMPs with different affinities. Ligands and receptors eventually oligomerize via defined modes into signaling complexes. Co-receptors recruit into these complexes to either inhibit or to promote signaling. The Smad pathway, initiated by phosphorylation through the activated type I receptors, results in transcriptional regulation of early target genes. However, on its way to the nucleus, Smads represent signaling platforms for other pathways, which eventually finetune BMP signal transduction. We also describe BMP-induced signaling cascades leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements, non-transcriptional and non-Smad pathways. BMPs induce a plethora of different cellular effects ranging from stem cell maintenance, migration, differentiation, proliferation to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism, by which the same ligand induces these manifold effects, depends on the cellular context. Here we try to give a current picture of the most important players in regulating and directing BMP signaling towards the desired cellular outcome. Examples of BMP action during development, but also physiological and pathophysiological conditions in the adult organism are presented.},

The cell-cell distribution of protein levels in microorganisms has been well characterized but little is known about such variability in human cells. Here, we studied the variability of protein levels in human cells, as well as the temporal dynamics of this variability, and addressed whether cells with higher than average protein levels eventually have lower than average levels, and if so, over what timescale does this mixing occur. We measured fluctuations over time in the levels of 20 endogenous proteins in living human cells, tagged by the gene for yellow fluorescent protein at their chromosomal loci. We found variability with a standard deviation that ranged, for different proteins, from about 15\% to 30\% of the mean. Mixing between high and low levels occurred for all proteins, but the mixing time was longer than two cell generations (more than 40 h) for many proteins. We also tagged pairs of proteins with two colours, and found that the levels of proteins in the same biological pathway were far more correlated than those of proteins in different pathways. The persistent memory for protein levels that we found might underlie individuality in cell behaviour and could set a timescale needed for signals to affect fully every member of a cell population.},

abstract = {Intestinal development is a process of continuous dynamic bidirectional crosstalk between epithelial and underlying mesenchymal cells. This crosstalk is mediated by well-dissected signaling pathways. Another crucial actor in the epithelio-mesenchymal interactions is the stromal microenvironment, which is composed of extracellular matrix molecules. Among them, the basement membrane (BM) molecules are secreted by the epithelium and mesenchyme in a complementary manner. These molecules signal back to the cells via the integrins or other specific receptors. In this review, we mainly focus on the BM molecules, particularly laminins. The major BM molecules are organized in a complex molecular network, which is highly variable among organs. Cell culture, coculture, and grafting models have been of great interest in understanding the importance of these molecules. Mouse gene ablation of laminin chains are interesting models, which often lead to embryonic death and are frequently accompanied by compensatory processes. Overall, the BM molecules have a crucial role in the careful maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.},

However, recent evidence suggests that balance can also be achieved at the level of the stem cell population. Some stem cells might be lost due to differentiation or damage, whereas others divide symmetrically to fill this gap.

abstract = {Genetically identical cell populations exhibit considerable intercellular variation in the level of a given protein or mRNA. Both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise drive this variability in gene expression. More specifically, extrinsic noise is the expression variability that arises from cell-to-cell differences in cell-specific factors such as enzyme levels, cell size and cell cycle stage. In contrast, intrinsic noise is the expression variability that is not accounted for by extrinsic noise, and typically arises from the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes. Two-color reporter experiments are employed to decompose expression variability into its intrinsic and extrinsic noise components. Analytical formulas for intrinsic and extrinsic noise are derived for a class of stochastic gene expression models, where variations in cell-specific factors cause fluctuations in model parameters, in particular, transcription and/or translation rate fluctuations. Assuming mRNA production occurs in random bursts, transcription rate is represented by either the burst frequency (how often the bursts occur) or the burst size (number of mRNAs produced in each burst). Our analysis shows that fluctuations in the transcription burst frequency enhance extrinsic noise but do not affect the intrinsic noise. On the contrary, fluctuations in the transcription burst size or mRNA translation rate dramatically increase both intrinsic and extrinsic noise components. Interestingly, simultaneous fluctuations in transcription and translation rates arising from randomness in ATP abundance can decrease intrinsic noise measured in a two-color reporter assay. Finally, we discuss how these formulas can be combined with single-cell gene expression data from two-color reporter experiments for estimating model parameters.},

abstract = {Cellular populations have been widely observed to respond heterogeneously to perturbation. However, interpreting the observed heterogeneity is an extremely challenging problem because of the complexity of possible cellular phenotypes, the large dimension of potential perturbations, and the lack of methods for separating meaningful biological information from noise. Here, we develop an image-based approach to characterize cellular phenotypes based on patterns of signaling marker colocalization. Heterogeneous cellular populations are characterized as mixtures of phenotypically distinct subpopulations, and responses to perturbations are summarized succinctly as probabilistic redistributions of these mixtures. We apply our method to characterize the heterogeneous responses of cancer cells to a panel of drugs. We find that cells treated with drugs of (dis-)similar mechanism exhibit (dis-)similar patterns of heterogeneity. Despite the observed phenotypic diversity of cells observed within our data, low-complexity models of heterogeneity were sufficient to distinguish most classes of drug mechanism. Our approach offers a computational framework for assessing the complexity of cellular heterogeneity, investigating the degree to which perturbations induce redistributions of a limited, but nontrivial, repertoire of underlying states and revealing functional significance contained within distinct patterns of heterogeneous responses.},

abstract = {The maintenance of stem-cell-driven tissue homeostasis requires a balance between the generation and loss of cell mass. Adult stem cells have a close relationship with the surrounding tissue--known as their niche--and thus, stem-cell studies should preferably be performed in a physiological context, rather than outside their natural environment. The mouse is an attractive model in which to study adult mammalian stem cells, as numerous experimental systems and genetic tools are available. In this review, we describe strategies commonly used to identify and functionally characterize adult stem cells in mice and discuss their potential, limitations and interpretations, as well as how they have informed our understanding of adult stem-cell biology. An accurate interpretation of physiologically relevant stem-cell assays is crucial to identify adult stem cells and elucidate how they self-renew and give rise to differentiated progeny.},

abstract = {In recent years, many mouse models have been developed to mark and trace the fate of adult cell populations using fluorescent proteins. High-resolution visualization of such fluorescent markers in their physiological setting is thus an important aspect of adult stem cell research. Here we describe a protocol to produce sections (150-200 $\mu$m) of near-native tissue with optimal tissue and cellular morphology by avoiding artifacts inherent in standard freezing or embedding procedures. The activity of genetically expressed fluorescent proteins is maintained, thereby enabling high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of fluorescent structures in virtually all types of tissues. The procedure allows immunofluorescence labeling of proteins to depths up to 50 $\mu$m, as well as a chemical 'Click-iT' reaction to detect DNA-intercalating analogs such as ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU). Generation of near-native sections ready for imaging analysis takes approximately 2-3 h. Postsectioning processes, such as antibody labeling or EdU detection, take up to 10 h.},

abstract = {In vertebrate embryos, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) undergo long-range migration after emerging from the primitive streak during gastrulation. Together with other mesoderm progenitors, they migrate laterally and then toward the ventral midline, where they form the heart. Signals controlling the migration of different progenitor cell populations during gastrulation are poorly understood. Several pathways are involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingression of mesoderm cells through the primitive streak, including fibroblast growth factors and wingless-type family members (Wnt). Here we focus on early CPC migration and use live video microscopy in chicken embryos to demonstrate a role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMA and MAD related (Smad) signaling. We identify an interaction of BMP and Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3$\beta$) pathways via the differential phosphorylation of Smad1. Increased BMP2 activity altered migration trajectories of prospective cardiac cells and resulted in their lateral displacement and ectopic differentiation, as they failed to reach the ventral midline. Constitutively active BMP receptors or constitutively active Smad1 mimicked this phenotype, suggesting a cell autonomous response. Expression of GSK3$\beta$, which promotes the turnover of active Smad1, rescued the BMP-induced migration phenotype. Conversely, expression of GSK3$\beta$-resistant Smad1 resulted in aberrant CPC migration trajectories. De-repression of GSK3$\beta$ by dominant negative Wnt3a restored normal migration patterns in the presence of high BMP activity. The data indicate the convergence of BMP and Wnt pathways on Smad1 during the early migration of prospective cardiac cells. Overall, we reveal molecular mechanisms that contribute to the emerging paradigm of signaling pathway integration in embryo development.},

abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the approximately 98 million base pair nuclear genome of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis suggests that placozoans belong to a 'eumetazoan' clade that includes cnidarians and bilaterians, with sponges as the earliest diverging animals. The compact genome shows conserved gene content, gene structure and synteny in relation to the human and other complex eumetazoan genomes. Despite the apparent cellular and organismal simplicity of Trichoplax, its genome encodes a rich array of transcription factor and signalling pathway genes that are typically associated with diverse cell types and developmental processes in eumetazoans, motivating further searches for cryptic cellular complexity and/or as yet unobserved life history stages.},

abstract = {When cell cycle studies are performed following cell cycle synchronization, it is possible that critical properties of an actively cycling cell will be overlooked. For this reason past studies have not revealed critical aspects of cell cycle control; such as how a cell determines when to exit the cell cycle, or how rapidly it should cycle. To address these challenging questions we have developed a procedure to quantitate fluorescent stains in a monolayer culture, where nuclear fluorescence and cell cycle history can be assessed with accuracy on a cell by cell basis. The cell cycle position of each cell can be determined by analyzing DNA and BrdU levels. The behavior of cells in a given cell cycle position can then be studied by quantitating up to two other stained markers. When the microinjection of siRNA, neutralizing antibodies, and expression plasmids are coupled with quantitative image analysis, these cell cycle studies can be conducted following alterations in the expression levels of selected cellular targets. With these techniques we have discovered critical aspects of cell cycle control; including how cyclin D1 levels vary through the cell cycle, the molecular mechanisms governing these changes, and the biological implications of changes in cyclin D1 concentration in various cell cycle stages. Our studies with cyclin D1, coupled with similar studies of p27Kip1, form the basis of an entirely new model of cell cycle control proposed here. This model explains how cell cycle progression is terminated, and how the length of the cell cycle is regulated.},

Here we discuss the apparent discrepancy between the classic sequential assembly model based mostly on biochemistry and an emerging dynamic assembly model based mostly on fluorescence microscopy. The former model favors a stable transcription complex with subunits that cooperatively assemble in order, whereas the latter model favors an unstable complex with subunits that may assemble more randomly. To confront this apparent discrepancy, we review the merits and drawbacks of the different experimental approaches and list potential biasing factors that could be responsible for the different interpretations of assembly. We then discuss how these biases might be overcome in the future with improved experiments or new techniques. Finally, we discuss how kinetic models for assembly may help resolve the ordered and stable vs. random and dynamic assembly debate.},

abstract = {Zebrafish fully regenerate lost bone, including after fin amputation, through a process mediated by dedifferentiated, lineage-restricted osteoblasts. Mechanisms controlling the osteoblast regenerative program from its initiation through reossification are poorly understood. We show that fin amputation induces a Wnt/$\beta$-catenin-dependent epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of osteoblasts in order to generate proliferative Runx2(+) preosteoblasts. Localized Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling maintains this progenitor population toward the distal tip of the regenerative blastema. As they become proximally displaced, preosteoblasts upregulate sp7 and subsequently mature into re-epithelialized Runx2(-)/sp7(+) osteoblasts that extend preexisting bone. Autocrine bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling promotes osteoblast differentiation by activating sp7 expression and counters Wnt by inducing Dickkopf-related Wnt antagonists. As such, opposing activities of Wnt and BMP coordinate the simultaneous demand for growth and differentiation during bone regeneration. This hierarchical signaling network model provides a conceptual framework for understanding innate bone repair and regeneration mechanisms and rationally designing regenerative therapeutics.},

abstract = {Knock out of intestinal Cdx2 produces different effects depending upon the developmental stage at which this occurs. Early in development it produces histologically ordered stomach mucosa in the midgut. Conditional inactivation of Cdx2 in adult intestinal epithelium, as well as specifically in the Lgr5-positive stem cells, of adult mice allows long-term survival of the animals but fails to produce this phenotype. Instead, the endodermal cells exhibit cell-autonomous expression of gastric genes in an intestinal setting that is not accompanied by mesodermal expression of Barx1, which is necessary for gastric morphogenesis. Cdx2-negative endodermal cells also fail to express Sox2, a marker of gastric morphogenesis. Maturation of the stem cell niche thus appears to be associated with loss of ability to express positional information cues that are required for normal stomach development. Cdx2-negative intestinal crypts produce subsurface cystic vesicles, whereas untargeted crypts hypertrophy to later replace the surface epithelium. These observations are supported by studies involving inactivation of Cdx2 in intestinal crypts cultured in vitro. This abolishes their ability to form long-term growing intestinal organoids that differentiate into intestinal phenotypes. We conclude that expression of Cdx2 is essential for differentiation of gut stem cells into any of the intestinal cell types, but they maintain a degree of cell-autonomous plasticity that allows them to switch on a variety of gastric genes.},

When individual colonies appeared to be mature, they were examined for cellular composition by May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining and were replated for determination of unexpressed hemopoietic potentials. We describe here a total of 50 mixed hemopoietic colonies. Seven types of colonies consisting of cells in two different lineages were seen--i.e., neutrophil-macrophage, neutrophil-eosinophil, macrophage-eosinophil, macrophage-mast cell, macrophage-megakaryocyte, macrophage-erythrocyte, and erythrocyte-megakaryocyte. Six types of colonies revealed three cell lineages--i.e., neutrophil-macrophage-eosinophil, neutrophil-macrophage-mast cell, neutrophil-macrophage-erythrocyte, macrophage-mast cell-erythrocyte, neutrophil-macrophage-megakaryocyte, and neutrophil-erythrocyte-megakaryocyte lineages. In addition, multilineage colonies expressing terminal differentiation in varying combinations of more than three lineages were present. Replating studies confirmed that the progenitors for many of these colonies are terminally committed to differentiation only in the lineages disclosed by staining. This study, thus, provides a proof for the single-cell origin of mouse hemopoietic colonies expressing various combinations of cell lineages. It also supports the hypothesis that the differentiation of multipotential hemopoietic progenitors is through progressive and stochastic restriction in cell lineages.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal in biology is to gain a quantitative understanding of how appropriate cell responses are achieved amid conflicting signals that work in parallel. Through live, single-cell imaging, we monitored both the dynamics of nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) signaling and inflammatory cytokine transcription in macrophages exposed to the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our analysis revealed a previously uncharacterized positive feedback loop involving induction of the expression of Rela, which encodes the RelA (p65) NF-$\kappa$B subunit. This positive feedback loop rewired the regulatory network when cells were exposed to LPS above a distinct concentration. Paradoxically, this rewiring of NF-$\kappa$B signaling in macrophages (a myeloid cell type) required the transcription factor Ikaros, which promotes the development of lymphoid cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation showed that the RelA positive feedback overcame existing negative feedback loops and enabled cells to discriminate between different concentrations of LPS to mount an effective innate immune response only at higher concentrations. We suggest that this switching in the relative dominance of feedback loops ("feedback dominance switching") may be a general mechanism in immune cells to integrate opposing feedback on a key transcriptional regulator and to set a response threshold for the host.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) is upregulated at the time of arterial injury; however, the mechanism through which TGF-$\beta$ enhances the development of intimal hyperplasia is not clear. Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that in the presence of elevated levels of Smad3, TGF-$\beta$ stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. This is a novel phenomenon in that TGF-$\beta$ has traditionally been known as a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation. In these studies we explore the signaling pathways through which TGF-$\beta$ mediates its proliferative effect in vascular SMCs. We found that TGF-$\beta$ phosphorylates and activates Akt in a time-dependent manner, and this effect is significantly enhanced by overexpression of Smad3. Furthermore, both chemical and molecular inhibition of Smad3 can reverse the effect of TGF-$\beta$ on Akt. Although we found numerous signaling pathways that might function as intermediates between Smad3 and Akt, p38 appeared the most promising. Overexpression of Smad3 enhanced p38 phosphorylation and inhibition of p38 with a chemical inhibitor or a small interfering RNA blocked TGF-$\beta$-induced Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, TGF-$\beta$/Smad3 enhancement of SMC proliferation was blocked by inhibition of p38. Phosphorylation of Akt by TGF-$\beta$/Smad3 was not dependent on gene expression or protein synthesis, and immunoprecipitation studies revealed a physical association among p38, Akt, and Smad3 suggesting that activation requires a direct protein-protein interaction. Our findings were confirmed in vivo where overexpression of Smad3 in a rat carotid injury model led to enhancement of p-p38, p-Akt, as well as SMC proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of p38 in vivo led to decreased Akt phosphorylation and SMC proliferation. In summary, our studies reveal a novel pathway whereby TGF-$\beta$/Smad3 stimulates SMC proliferation through p38 and Akt. These findings provide a potential mechanism for the substantial effect of TGF-$\beta$ on intimal hyperplasia and suggest new targets for chemical or molecular prevention of vascular restenosis.},

abstract = {Canonical Wnt signaling requires inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) activity, but the molecular mechanism by which this is achieved remains unclear. Here, we report that Wnt signaling triggers the sequestration of GSK3 from the cytosol into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), so that this enzyme becomes separated from its many cytosolic substrates. Endocytosed Wnt colocalized with GSK3 in acidic vesicles positive for endosomal markers. After Wnt addition, endogenous GSK3 activity decreased in the cytosol, and GSK3 became protected from protease treatment inside membrane-bounded organelles. Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy showed that these corresponded to MVBs. Two proteins essential for MVB formation, HRS/Vps27 and Vps4, were required for Wnt signaling. The sequestration of GSK3 extended the half-life of many other proteins in addition to $\beta$-Catenin, including an artificial Wnt-regulated reporter protein containing GSK3 phosphorylation sites. We conclude that multivesicular endosomes are essential components of the Wnt signal-transduction pathway.},

Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes.

abstract = {Cells operate in dynamic environments using extraordinary communication capabilities that emerge from the interactions of genetic circuitry. The mammalian immune response is a striking example of the coordination of different cell types. Cell-to-cell communication is primarily mediated by signalling molecules that form spatiotemporal concentration gradients, requiring cells to respond to a wide range of signal intensities. Here we use high-throughput microfluidic cell culture and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate how single mammalian cells respond to different concentrations of the signalling molecule tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and relay information to the gene expression programs by means of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. We measured NF-kappaB activity in thousands of live cells under TNF-alpha doses covering four orders of magnitude. We find, in contrast to population-level studies with bulk assays, that the activation is heterogeneous and is a digital process at the single-cell level with fewer cells responding at lower doses. Cells also encode a subtle set of analogue parameters to modulate the outcome; these parameters include NF-kappaB peak intensity, response time and number of oscillations. We developed a stochastic mathematical model that reproduces both the digital and analogue dynamics as well as most gene expression profiles at all measured conditions, constituting a broadly applicable model for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling in various types of cells. These results highlight the value of high-throughput quantitative measurements with single-cell resolution in understanding how biological systems operate.},

abstract = {Wnt/Frizzled/ss-catenin-based signaling systems play diverse roles in metazoan development, being involved not only in the establishment of body axes in embryogenesis but also in regulating stem cell fate in mammalian post-embryonic development. We have studied the role the canonical Wnt cascade plays in stem cell fate determination in Hydractinia, a member of the ancient metazoan phylum Cnidaria, by analyzing two key molecules in this pathway, frizzled and ss-catenin, and blocking GSK-3. Generally, frizzled was expressed in cells able to divide but absent in post-mitotic, terminally differentiated cells such as nerve cells and nematocytes. Transcripts of frizzled were identified in all embryonic stages beginning with maternal transcripts in the oocyte. Following gastrulation and in the planula larva, frizzled expression concentrated in the central endodermal mass from which the first interstitial stem cells and their derivatives arise. In post-metamorphic development, high levels of frizzled transcripts were detected in interstitial stem cells. Activating downstream events of the Wnt-cascade in the post-metamorphic life phase by blocking GSK-3 with paullones induced recruitment of nematocytes and nerve cells from the pool of interstitial stem cells. Terminal differentiation was preceded by an initial burst of proliferation of frizzled-positive i-cells. In activated i-cells, ss-catenin appeared in the cytoplasm, later in the nucleus. It was subsequently again observed in the cytoplasm and eventually faded out during terminal differentiation. Our results suggest an ancient role of Wnt signaling in stem cell fate determination.},

abstract = {Cells are intrinsically noisy biochemical reactors: low reactant numbers can lead to significant statistical fluctuations in molecule numbers and reaction rates. Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

abstract = {Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene mutations predispose carriers to kidney cancer. The protein pVHL has been shown to interact with microtubules (MTs), which is critical to cilia maintenance and mitotic spindle orientation. However, the function for pVHL in the regulation of MT dynamics is unknown. We tracked MT growth via the plus end marker EB3 (end-binding protein 3)-GFP and inferred additional parameters of MT dynamics indirectly by spatiotemporal grouping of growth tracks from live cell imaging. Our data establish pVHL as a near-optimal MT-stabilizing protein: it attenuates tubulin turnover, both during MT growth and shrinkage, inhibits catastrophe, and enhances rescue frequencies. These functions are mediated, in part, by inhibition of tubulin guanosine triphosphatase activity in vitro and at MT plus ends and along the MT lattice in vivo. Mutants connected to the VHL cancer syndrome are differentially compromised in these activities. Thus, single cell-level analysis of pVHL MT regulatory function allows new predictions for genotype to phenotype associations that deviate from the coarser clinically defined mutant classifications.},

abstract = {BMP, PTEN and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are the three signaling pathways that control normal development and regeneration of the intestine, and contribute to intestinal polyposis when aberrant inactivation or activation occurs in each of these pathways. Using genetic targeting of BMPR1A in mice, we show that inactivation of BMP signaling results in multiple polyps due to an increased number of crypts and stem cells, accompanied by enhanced Wnt signaling in all proliferating intestine cells. However the increased transcriptional activity of Wnt effecter protein, beta-catenin, is found primarily in intestine stem cells (ISCs). Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. By conducting a proteomic analysis of the beta-catenin complex, we show that 14-3-3zeta exists in the beta-catenin complex and facilitates activation of beta-catenin by Akt, which, intriguingly, appears to be predominantly in ISCs. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta.},

Use of inhibitors of TGF-beta signaling may thus be a novel strategy for the treatment of patients with such cancer. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a small molecule inhibitor, A-83-01, which is structurally similar to previously reported ALK-5 inhibitors developed by Sawyer et al. (2003) and blocks signaling of type I serine/threonine kinase receptors for cytokines of the TGF-beta superfamily (known as activin receptor-like kinases; ALKs). Using a TGF-beta-responsive reporter construct in mammalian cells, we found that A-83-01 inhibited the transcriptional activity induced by TGF-beta type I receptor ALK-5 and that by activin type IB receptor ALK-4 and nodal type I receptor ALK-7, the kinase domains of which are structurally highly related to those of ALK-5. A-83-01 was found to be more potent in the inhibition of ALK5 than a previously described ALK-5 inhibitor, SB-431542, and also to prevent phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and the growth inhibition induced by TGF-beta. In contrast, A-83-01 had little or no effect on bone morphogenetic protein type I receptors, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, or extracellular regulated kinase. Consistent with these findings, A-83-01 inhibited the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-beta, suggesting that A-83-01 and related molecules may be useful for preventing the progression of advanced cancers.},

abstract = {We present an integrated method that uses extended time-lapse automated imaging to quantify the dynamics of cell proliferation. Cell counts are fit with a quiescence-growth model that estimates rates of cell division, entry into quiescence and death. The model is constrained with rates extracted experimentally from the behavior of tracked single cells over time. We visualize the output of the analysis in fractional proliferation graphs, which deconvolve dynamic proliferative responses to perturbations into the relative contributions of dividing, quiescent (nondividing) and dead cells. The method reveals that the response of 'oncogene-addicted' human cancer cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is a composite of altered rates of division, death and entry into quiescence, a finding that challenges the notion that such cells simply die in response to oncogene-targeted therapy.},

Subsequent cloning of TCF-1 identified three splice alternatives. TCF-1 contained a single DNA-binding HMG box most closely related to similar boxes in the putative mammalian sex-determining gene SRY and in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mc mating type gene. TCF-1 mRNA was expressed uniquely in T lymphocytes. Upon cotransfection into non-T cells, TCF-1 could transactivate through its cognate motif. These results identify TCF-1 as a T cell-specific transcription factor, which might play a role in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype.},

abstract = {The transactivation of TCF target genes induced by Wnt pathway mutations constitutes the primary transforming event in colorectal cancer (CRC). We show that disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity in CRC cells induces a rapid G1 arrest and blocks a genetic program that is physiologically active in the proliferative compartment of colon crypts. Coincidently, an intestinal differentiation program is induced. The TCF-4 target gene c-MYC plays a central role in this switch by direct repression of the p21(CIP1/WAF1) promoter. Following disruption of beta-catenin/TCF-4 activity, the decreased expression of c-MYC releases p21(CIP1/WAF1) transcription, which in turn mediates G1 arrest and differentiation. Thus, the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex constitutes the master switch that controls proliferation versus differentiation in healthy and malignant intestinal epithelial cells.},

Proliferative cells are confined to crypts, while differentiated cell types predominantly occupy the villi. We recently demonstrated the existence of a long-lived pool of cycling stem cells defined by Lgr5 expression and intermingled with post-mitotic Paneth cells at crypt bottoms. We have now determined a gene signature for these Lgr5 stem cells. One of the genes within this stem cell signature is the Wnt target Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2). Transgenic expression of the Ascl2 transcription factor throughout the intestinal epithelium induces crypt hyperplasia and ectopic crypts on villi. Induced deletion of the Ascl2 gene in adult small intestine leads to disappearance of the Lgr5 stem cells within days. The combined results from these gain- and loss-of-function experiments imply that Ascl2 controls intestinal stem cell fate.},

Signalling pathways, including the Notch signalling pathway, coordinate these differentiation processes and their deregulation may cause cancer. Pharmacological inhibition through $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors or genetic inactivation of the Notch signalling pathway results in the complete loss of proliferating crypt progenitors due to their conversion into post-mitotic goblet cells. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Math1 is essential for intestinal secretory cell differentiation. Because of the critical roles of both Math1 and Notch signalling in intestinal homeostasis and neoplastic transformation, we sought to determine the genetic hierarchy regulating the differentiation of intestinal stem cells into secretory cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that the conversion of intestinal stem cells into goblet cells upon inhibition of the Notch signalling pathway requires Math1.},

Recent evidence indicates that the Wnt cascade is the dominant force in controlling cell fate along the crypt-villus axis. Here we show a rapid, massive conversion of proliferative crypt cells into post-mitotic goblet cells after conditional removal of the common Notch pathway transcription factor CSL/RBP-J. We obtained a similar phenotype by blocking the Notch cascade with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. The inhibitor also induced goblet cell differentiation in adenomas in mice carrying a mutation of the Apc tumour suppressor gene. Thus, maintenance of undifferentiated, proliferative cells in crypts and adenomas requires the concerted activation of the Notch and Wnt cascades. Our data indicate that gamma-secretase inhibitors, developed for Alzheimer's disease, might be of therapeutic benefit in colorectal neoplastic disease.},

abstract = {Clonal populations of microbial cells often show a high degree of phenotypic variability under homogeneous conditions. Stochastic fluctuations in the cellular components that determine cellular states can cause two distinct subpopulations, a property called bistability. Phenotypic heterogeneity can be readily obtained by interlinking multiple gene regulatory pathways, effectively resulting in a genetic logic-AND gate. Although switching between states can occur within the cells' lifetime, cells can also pass their cellular state over to the next generation by a mechanism known as epigenetic inheritance and thus perpetuate the phenotypic state. Importantly, heterogeneous populations can demonstrate increased fitness compared with homogeneous populations. This suggests that microbial cells employ bet-hedging strategies to maximize survival. Here, we discuss the possible roles of interlinked bistable networks, epigenetic inheritance, and bet-hedging in bacteria.},

abstract = {Surprisingly few pathways signal between cells, raising questions about mechanisms for tissue-specific responses. In particular, Wnt ligands signal in many mammalian tissues, including the intestinal epithelium, where constitutive signaling causes cancer. Genome-wide analysis of DNA cis-regulatory regions bound by the intestine-restricted transcription factor CDX2 in colonic cells uncovered highly significant overrepresentation of sequences that bind TCF4, a transcriptional effector of intestinal Wnt signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed TCF4 occupancy at most such sites and co-occupancy of CDX2 and TCF4 across short distances. A region spanning the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6983267, which lies within a MYC enhancer and confers colorectal cancer risk in humans, represented one of many co-occupied sites. Co-occupancy correlated with intestine-specific gene expression and CDX2 loss reduced TCF4 binding. These results implicate CDX2 in directing TCF4 binding in intestinal cells. Co-occupancy of regulatory regions by signal-effector and tissue-restricted transcription factors may represent a general mechanism for ubiquitous signaling pathways to achieve tissue-specific outcomes.},

While all of these inhibitors have been reported as “selective” inhibitors of specific ALKs, extensive specificity tests against a wide array of protein kinases have not been performed. In this study, we examine the specificities and potencies of the most frequently used small molecule inhibitors of the TGF\ss pathway (SB-431542, SB-505124, LY-364947 and A-83-01) and the BMP pathway (Dorsomorphin and LDN-193189) against a panel of up to 123 protein kinases covering a broad spectrum of the human kinome. We demonstrate that the inhibitors of the TGF\ss pathway are relatively more selective than the inhibitors of the BMP pathway. Based on our specificity and potency profile and published data, we recommend SB-505124 as the most suitable molecule for use as an inhibitor of ALKs 4, 5 and 7 and the TGF\ss pathway. We do not recommend Dorsomorphin, also called Compound C, for use as an inhibitor of the BMP pathway. Although LDN-193189, a Dorsomorphin derivative, is a very potent inhibitor of ALK2/3 and the BMP-pathway, we found that it potently inhibited a number of other protein kinases at concentrations sufficient to inhibit ALK2/3 and its use as a selective BMP-pathway inhibitor has to be considered cautiously. Our observations have highlighted the need for caution when using these small molecule inhibitors to assess the physiological roles of BMP and TGF\ss pathways.},

abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-beta superfamily of secreted signaling molecules, have important functions in many biological contexts. They bind to specific serine/threonine kinase receptors, which transduce the signal to the nucleus through Smad proteins. The question of how BMPs can have such diverse effects while using the same canonical Smad pathway has recently come closer to an answer at the molecular level. Nuclear cofactors have been identified that cooperate with the Smads in regulating specific target genes depending on the cellular context. In addition, the pivotal role BMP signaling plays is underscored by the identification of factors that regulate members of this pathway at the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. Many of these factors are BMP-inducible and inhibit the BMP pathway, thus establishing negative feedback loops. Members of the BMP-Smad pathway can also physically interact with components of other signaling pathways to establish crosstalk. Finally, there is accumulating evidence that an alternative pathway involving MAP kinases can transduce BMP signals. The evidence and implications of these findings are discussed with an emphasis on early embryonic development of Xenopus and vertebrates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Identification of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) has relied heavily on the use of transgenic reporters in mice, but this approach is limited by mosaic expression patterns, and difficulty to directly apply to human tissues. We sought to identify reliable surface markers of ISCs and establish a robust functional assay to characterize ISCs from mouse and human tissues. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcription PCR, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to analyze intestinal epithelial cells isolated from mouse and human intestinal tissues. We compared different combinations of surface markers among ISCs isolated based on expression of Lgr5-green fluorescent protein (GFP). We developed a culture protocol to facilitate the identification of functional ISCs from mice, and then tested the assay with human intestinal crypts and putative ISCs. RESULTS: CD44(+)CD24(lo)CD166(+) cells, sorted by FACS from mouse small intestine and colon, expressed high levels of stem-cell associated genes. Transit amplifying cells and progenitor cells were then excluded based on expression of GRP78 or c-Kit. CD44(+)CD24(lo)CD166(+) GRP78 (lo/-) putative stem cells from mouse small intestine included Lgr5-GFP(hi) and Lgr5-GFP(med/lo) cells. Incubation of these cells with the GSK inhibitor CHIR99021 and the E-cadherin stabilizer Thiazovivin resulted in colony formation by 25\%-30\% of single-sorted ISCs. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a culture protocol to identify putative ISCs from mouse and human tissues based on cell surface markers. CD44(+)CD24(lo)CD166(+), GRP78(lo/-) and c-Kit(-) facilitated identification of putative stem cells from the mouse small intestine and colon respectively. CD44(+)CD24(-/lo)CD166(+) also identified putative human ISCs. These findings will facilitate functional studies of mouse and human ISCs.},

abstract = {Neutrophil polarity relies on local, mutual inhibition to segregate incompatible signaling circuits to the leading and trailing edges. Mutual inhibition alone should lead to cells having strong fronts and weak backs or vice versa. However, analysis of cell-to-cell variation in human neutrophils revealed that back polarity remains consistent despite changes in front strength. How is this buffering achieved? Pharmacological perturbations and mathematical modeling revealed a functional role for microtubules in buffering back polarity by mediating positive, long-range crosstalk from front to back; loss of microtubules inhibits buffering and results in anticorrelation between front and back signaling. Furthermore, a systematic, computational search of network topologies found that a long-range, positive front-to-back link is necessary for back buffering. Our studies suggest a design principle that can be employed by polarity networks: short-range mutual inhibition establishes distinct signaling regions, after which directed long-range activation insulates one region from variations in the other.},

Extensive biochemical and genetic studies argue that the pathway is activated through R-Smad phosphorylation; however, the dynamics of signaling remain largely unexplored. We monitored signaling and transcriptional dynamics and found that although R-Smads stably translocate to the nucleus under continuous pathway stimulation, transcription of direct targets is transient. Surprisingly, Smad4 nuclear localization is confined to short pulses that coincide with transcriptional activity. Upon perturbation, the dynamics of transcription correlate with Smad4 nuclear localization rather than with R-Smad activity. In Xenopus embryos, Smad4 shows stereotyped, uncorrelated bursts of nuclear localization, but activated R-Smads are uniform. Thus, R-Smads relay graded information about ligand levels that is integrated with intrinsic temporal control reflected in Smad4 into the active signaling complex.},

abstract = {A yeast two-hybrid screen was utilized to identify novel Smad 3 binding proteins expressed in developing mouse orofacial tissue. Three proteins (Erbin, Par-3, and Dishevelled) were identified that share several similar structural and functional characteristics. Each contains at least one PDZ domain and all have been demonstrated to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. In GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assays, Erbin, Par-3, and Dishevelled bound strongly to the isolated MH2 domain of Smad 3, with weaker binding to a full-length Smad 3 protein. Failure of Erbin, Par-3, and Dishevelled to bind to a Smad 3 mutant protein that was missing the MH2 domain confirms that the binding site resides within the MH2 domain. Erbin, Par-3, and Dishevelled also interacted with the MH2 domains of other Smads, suggesting broad Smad binding specificity. Dishevelled and Erbin mutant proteins, in which the PDZ domain was removed, still retained their ability to bind Smad 3, albeit with lower affinity. While transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) has been suggested to alter cell polarity through a Smad-independent mechanism involving activation of members of the RhoA family of GTP binding proteins, the observation that Smads can directly interact with proteins involved in cell polarity, as shown in the present report, suggests an additional means by which TGF$\beta$ could alter cell polarity via a Smad-dependent signaling mechanism.},

abstract = {The transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and Wnt signaling pathways play central roles regulating embryogenesis and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. TGFbeta mediates its cellular effects through types I and II cell surface receptors coupled to the nucleocytoplasmic Smad proteins. Wnt signals via binding to a cell surface receptor, Frizzled, which in turn activates intracellular Dishevelled, ultimately leading to stabilization and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. Previous studies have demonstrated several points of cross-talk between the TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways. In yeast two-hybrid and GST-pull down assays, Dishevelled-1 and Smad 3 have been shown to physically interact through the C-terminal one-half of Dishevelled-1 and the MH2 domain of Smad 3. The current study demonstrates that co-treatment of murine embryonic maxillary mesenchyme (MEMM) cells with Wnt-3a and TGFbeta leads to enhanced reporter activity from TOPflash, a Wnt-responsive reporter plasmid. Transcriptional cooperation between TGFbeta and Wnt did not require the presence of a Smad binding element, nor did it occur when a TGFbeta-responsive reporter plasmid (p3TP-lux) was transfected. Overexpression of Smad 3 further enhanced the cooperation between Wnt and TGFbeta while overexpression of dominant-negative Smads 2 and 3 inhibited this effect. Co-stimulation with TGFbeta led to greater nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, providing explanation for the effect of TGFbeta on Wnt-3a reporter activity. Wnt-3a exerted antiproliferative activity in MEMM cells, similar to that exerted by TGFbeta. In addition, Wnt-3a and TGFbeta in combination led to synergistic decreases in MEMM cell proliferation. These data demonstrate a functional interaction between the TGFbeta and Wnt signaling pathways and suggest that Wnt activation of the canonical pathway is an important mediator of MEMM cell growth.},

Furthermore, dissociated hES cells treated with Y-27632 are protected from apoptosis even in serum-free suspension (SFEB) culture and form floating aggregates.

abstract = {Smad family proteins play a pivotal role in transmitting the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. In response to ligand stimulation, Smad4 forms a complex with respective receptor-specific Smads, and the complex translocates into the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Thus, the nuclear entry of the Smad complex is one of the key steps in signal transduction. However, little is known about regulatory mechanisms for nucleocytoplasmic transport of Smads. Here we report identification of a functional, leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in Smad4, which regulates subcellular distribution of Smad4. We then show evidence suggesting that the NES-dependent cytoplasmic localization of Smad4 is important for ensuring optimal TGF-beta responsivenesses in transcriptional activation. Moreover, we show that the NES of Smad4 is specifically inactivated by the stimulus-dependent hetero-oligomerization with receptor-specific Smads during the TGF-beta-induced nuclear translocation of Smad4. Taken together, these results suggest an important regulatory role of the NES of Smad4 in TGF-beta signaling.},

abstract = {Although many of the regulators of actin assembly are known, we do not understand how these components act together to organize cell shape and movement. To address this question, we analyzed the spatial dynamics of a key actin regulator--the Scar/WAVE complex--which plays an important role in regulating cell shape in both metazoans and plants. We have recently discovered that the Hem-1/Nap1 component of the Scar/WAVE complex localizes to propagating waves that appear to organize the leading edge of a motile immune cell, the human neutrophil. Actin is both an output and input to the Scar/WAVE complex: the complex stimulates actin assembly, and actin polymer is also required to remove the complex from the membrane. These reciprocal interactions appear to generate propagated waves of actin nucleation that exhibit many of the properties of morphogenesis in motile cells, such as the ability of cells to flow around barriers and the intricate spatial organization of protrusion at the leading edge. We propose that cell motility results from the collective behavior of multiple self-organizing waves.},

abstract = {An image processing system with applications in bacterial (immuno-)fluorescence measurement has been developed. To reach quantitative results, correction for non-uniformities in system sensitivity, both as a function of time (calibration for drifts) and as a function of image coordinates (shading correction), is essential. Both problems can be handled simultaneously by acquiring images of a uniformly fluorescent, solid standard as a reference image. To measure bacterial fluorescence, the average fluorescence intensity of isolated areas of interest (the bacteria) is computed, and corrected using the reference images. Two shading correction methods are theoretically and experimentally compared: direct averaging in the corrected image, and (weighted and unweighted) averaging using the raw image and a separate shading image to determine the weights and correct for shading during the averaging. The latter method proved computationally 3.5–6.5 times faster on average and reduced propagation of truncation errors during computation, resulting in 40\% less noise, for 8-bits/pixel images.},

abstract = {Wnt signalling is involved in numerous events in animal development, including the proliferation of stem cells and the specification of the neural crest. Wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific cell types, but in contrast to other developmental signalling molecules such as hedgehog proteins and the bone morphogenetic proteins, Wnt proteins have never been isolated in an active form. Although Wnt proteins are secreted from cells, secretion is usually inefficient and previous attempts to characterize Wnt proteins have been hampered by their high degree of insolubility. Here we have isolated active Wnt molecules, including the product of the mouse Wnt3a gene. By mass spectrometry, we found the proteins to be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine. Enzymatic removal of the palmitate or site-directed and natural mutations of the modified cysteine result in loss of activity, and indicate that the lipid is important for signalling. The purified Wnt3a protein induces self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells, signifying its potential use in tissue engineering.},

@article{Wolpert1969,
abstract = {The problem of pattern is considered in terms of how genetic information can be translated in a reliable manner to give specific and different spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Pattern formation thus differs from molecular differentiation which is mainly concerned with the control of synthesis of specific macromolecules within cells rather than the spatial arrangement of the cells. It is suggested that there may be a universal mechanism whereby the translation of genetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation is achieved. The basis of this is a mechanism whereby the cells in a developing system may have their position specified with respect to one or more points in the system. This specification of position is positional information. Cells which have their positional information specified with respect to the same set of points constitute a field. Positional information largely determines with respect to the cells' genome and developmental history the nature of its molecular differentiation. The specification of positional information in general precedes and is independent of molecular differentiation. The concept of positional information implies a co-ordinate system and polarity is defined as the direction in which positional information is specified or measured. Rules for the specification of positional information and polarity are discussed. Pattern regulation, which is the ability of the system to form the pattern even when parts are removed, or added, and to show size invariance as in the French Flag problem, is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to change their positional information and interpret this change. These concepts are applied in some detail to early sea urchin development, hydroid regeneration, pattern formation in the insect epidermis, and the development of the chick limb. It is concluded that these concepts provide a unifying framework within which a wide variety of patterns formed from fields may be discussed, and give new meaning to classical concepts such as induction, dominance and field. The concepts direct attention towards finding mechanisms whereby position and polarity are specified, and the nature of reference points and boundaries. More specifically, it is suggested that the mechanism is required to specify the position of about 50 cells in a line, relatively reliably, in about 10 hours. The size of embryonic fields is, surprisingly, usually less than 50 cells in any direction.},

abstract = {Maintenance of adult tissues is carried out by stem cells and is sustained throughout life in a highly ordered manner. Homeostasis within the stem-cell compartment is governed by positive- and negative-feedback regulation of instructive extrinsic and intrinsic signals. ErbB signalling is a prerequisite for maintenance of the intestinal epithelium following injury and tumour formation. As ErbB-family ligands and receptors are highly expressed within the stem-cell niche, we hypothesize that strong endogenous regulators must control the pathway in the stem-cell compartment. Here we show that Lrig1, a negative-feedback regulator of the ErbB receptor family, is highly expressed by intestinal stem cells and controls the size of the intestinal stem-cell niche by regulating the amplitude of growth-factor signalling. Intestinal stem-cell maintenance has so far been attributed to a combination of Wnt and Notch activation and Bmpr inhibition. Our findings reveal ErbB activation as a strong inductive signal for stem-cell proliferation. This has implications for our understanding of ErbB signalling in tissue development and maintenance and the progression of malignant disease.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily ligands control a diverse set of cellular processes by activating type I and type II serine-threonine receptor kinases. Canonical TGFbeta signaling is mediated via the TbetaRI/ALK5 type I receptor that phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 in their SXS motif to facilitate their activation and subsequent role in transcriptional regulation. Canonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling is mediated via the ALK1/2/3/6 type I receptors that phosphorylate Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 in their SXS motif. However, studies in endothelial cells have shown that TGFbeta can also lead to the phosphorylation of Smad1, dependent on ALK1 receptor activity. Here we present data showing that TGFbeta can significantly induce Smad1 phosphorylation in several non-endothelial cell lineages. Additionally, by using chemical inhibitors specific for the TGFbeta/activin/nodal (ALK4/5/7) and BMP (ALK1/2/3/6) type I receptors, we show that in some cell types TGFbeta induces Smad1 phosphorylation independently of the BMP type I receptors. Thus, TGFbeta-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation appears to occur via different receptor complexes in a cell type-specific manner.},

One crucial constraint is the generation of useful hypotheses about protein function.

We perform extensive genome-wide validations of our predictions and offer visualization methods for exploration of the large numbers of functional predictions. We identify potential new members of many existing functional categories including 285 candidate proteins involved in transcription, processing and transport of non-coding RNA molecules.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) is one of the growth factors expressed in the gut, and has been shown to play an important role in intestinal mucosal healing. We investigated the effects of TGF-$\beta$1 on the cellular functions of intestinal epithelial cells, and also evaluated its signaling pathways in these cells.

METHODS: We used the rat IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line for these studies. The expression of TGF-$\beta$1/Smad signaling molecules was examined. We evaluated the effect of TGF-$\beta$1 on the proliferation and differentiation by the BrdU incorporation assay and real-time PCR. We manipulated the expression levels of Smad2 and Smad3 using an adenovirus system and small interfering RNA to examine the signaling pathways. The expression of Smad2 and Smad3 along the crypt-villus axis was also examined in the murine intestine.

RESULTS: IEC-6 cells produced TGF-$\beta$1 and expressed functional TGF-$\beta$/Smad signaling molecules. The addition of TGF-$\beta$1 in the culture medium suppressed the proliferation and increased the expression of a differentiation marker of enterocytes, in a dose-dependent manner. The adenovirus-mediated and small interfering RNA-mediated studies clearly showed that the growth inhibitory effect and the promotion of differentiation were exerted through a Smad3-dependent and a Smad2-dependent pathway, respectively. IEC-6 cells exhibited upregulated expression of an inhibitory Smad (Smad7) as a form of negative feedback via a non-Smad pathway. Smad2 was predominantly expressed in villi, and Smad3 in crypts.

CONCLUSIONS: TGF-$\beta$1 regulates the cellular functions of intestinal epithelial cells through both Smad-dependent and non-Smad pathways.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are initiating events in the majority of sporadic colon cancers. A common characteristic of such tumors is reduction in the number of goblet cells that produce the mucin MUC2, the principal component of intestinal mucus. Consistent with these observations, we showed that Muc2 deficiency results in the spontaneous development of tumors along the entire gastrointestinal tract, independently of deregulated Wnt signaling. To dissect the complex interaction between Muc2 and Apc in intestinal tumorigenesis and to elucidate the mechanisms of tumor formation in Muc2(-/-) mice, we crossed the Muc2(-/-) mouse with two mouse models, Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+), each of which carries an inactivated Apc allele. The introduction of mutant Muc2 into Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+) mice greatly increased transformation induced by the Apc mutation and significantly shifted tumor development toward the colon as a function of Muc2 gene dosage. Furthermore, we showed that in compound double mutant mice, deregulation of Wnt signaling was the dominant mechanism of tumor formation. The increased tumor burden in the distal colon of Muc2/Apc double mutant mice was similar to the phenotype observed in Apc(Min/+) mice that are challenged to mount an inflammatory response, and consistent with this, gene expression profiles of epithelial cells from flat mucosa of Muc2-deficient mice suggested that Muc2 deficiency was associated with low levels of subclinical chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that Muc2(-/-) tumors develop through an inflammation-related pathway that is distinct from and can complement mechanisms of tumorigenesis in Apc(+/-) mice.},

High-content screening studies typically generate immense datasets of image-based phenotypic information, and how best to mine relevant phenotypic data is an unsolved challenge. Here, we introduce factor analysis as a data-driven tool for defining cell phenotypes and profiling compound activities. This method allows a large data reduction while retaining relevant information, and the data-derived factors used to quantify phenotype have discernable biological meaning. We used factor analysis of cells stained with fluorescent markers of cell cycle state to profile a compound library and cluster the hits into seven phenotypic categories. We then compared phenotypic profiles, chemical similarity and predicted protein binding activities of active compounds. By integrating these different descriptors of measured and potential biological activity, we can effectively draw mechanism-of-action inferences.},

We developed a tiled microarray approach to identify at high resolution the translational positions of 2278 nucleosomes over 482 kilobases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA, including almost all of chromosome III and 223 additional regulatory regions. The majority of the nucleosomes identified were well-positioned. We found a stereotyped chromatin organization at Pol II promoters consisting of a nucleosome-free region approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start codon flanked on both sides by positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome-free sequences were evolutionarily conserved and were enriched in poly-deoxyadenosine or poly-deoxythymidine sequences. Most occupied transcription factor binding motifs were devoid of nucleosomes, strongly suggesting that nucleosome positioning is a global determinant of transcription factor access.},

Fields have the remarkable property of self-regulation: for example, if the forelimb field is bisected, each half can give rise to a complete limb after transplantation, as discovered by Ross Harrison in 1918. Therefore, cells in the morphogenetic field are capable of long-range communication with each other in order to ascertain their position [1]. This positional information is relayed in the extracellular space in the form of concentration gradients of specific classes of extracellular molecules called 'morphogens' that trigger cellular responses by binding and activating cell surface receptors. Here, we focus on a family of morphogens called 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins' (BMPs), which has provided a new paradigm for signaling regulation in the extracellular space.},

abstract = {Cells need to allocate their limited resources to express a wide range of genes. To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

abstract = {The colonic crypt is home to several multipotent stem cells. These stem cells reside in a niche at the base of the crypt, which controls their behavior and maintains the stem cell’s homeostasis through a variety of signaling pathways and interactions. Several attempts have been made to define markers that can identify colonic stem cells, the most useful of which is Lgr5, a Wnt target gene. Although the crypt base contains several stem cells, each colonic crypt comprises a single clone of cells. Investigators have attempted to reconcile these apparently contradictory observations by conducting research into stem cell division. The propagation of stem-cell-acquired mutations through a crypt results in a monocryptal adenoma that, through crypt fission, develops into a microadenoma. Some early adenomas become polyclonal through an as yet unknown mechanism. The discovery of subpopulations of cancer cells that can initiate tumors when implanted into mice has renewed interest in the existence of cancer stem cells, especially with regard to their implications for the use of chemotherapy. Various potential markers of cancer stem cells have been investigated, particularly CD133, but the cancer stem cell theory still has some limitations.},

Both the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta)/Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/Wingless (Wg) pathways play essential roles in organismal patterning and growth, and their deregulation can lead to cancers. We describe a mechanism of interaction between Drosophila Wg and BMP signaling in which Wg target gene expression is antagonized by BMP signaling. In vivo, high levels of both an activated BMP receptor and the BMP effector Mad can inhibit the expression of Wg target genes. Conversely, loss of mad can induce Wg target gene expression. In addition, we find that ectopic expression in vivo of the Wg transcription factor dTcf is able to suppress the inhibitory effect caused by ectopic Mad. In vitro binding studies revealed competition for dTcf binding between Mad and the Wnt effector beta-catenin/Armadillo (Arm). Our in vivo genetic analyses and target gene studies support a mechanism consistent with the in vitro binding and competition studies, namely that BMP pathway components can repress Wg target gene expression by influencing the binding of Arm and dTcf.},

abstract = {Morphogens provide positional information for spatial patterns of gene expression during development. However, stochastic effects such as local fluctuations in morphogen concentration and noise in signal transduction make it difficult for cells to respond to their positions accurately enough to generate sharp boundaries between gene expression domains. During development of rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of hoxb1a in rhombomere 4 (r4) and krox20 in r3 and r5. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals rough edges around these gene expression domains, in which cells co-express hoxb1a and krox20 on either side of the boundary, and these sharpen within a few hours. Computational analysis of spatial stochastic models shows, surprisingly, that noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression actually promotes sharpening of boundaries between adjacent segments. In particular, fluctuations in RA initially induce a rough boundary that requires noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression to sharpen. This finding suggests a novel noise attenuation mechanism that relies on intracellular noise to induce switching and coordinate cellular decisions during developmental patterning.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput cell-based phenotypic screening has become an increasingly important technology for discovering new drug targets and assigning gene functions. Such experiments use hundreds of 96-well or 384-well plates, to cover whole-genome RNAi collections and/or chemical compound files, and often collect measurements that are sensitive to spatial background noise whose patterns can vary across individual plates. Correcting these position effects can substantially improve measurement accuracy and screening success.

RESULT: We developed SbacHTS (Spatial background noise correction for High-Throughput RNAi Screening) software for visualization, estimation and correction of spatial background noise in high-throughput RNAi screens. SbacHTS is supported on the Galaxy open-source framework with a user-friendly open access web interface. We find that SbacHTS software can effectively detect and correct spatial background noise, increase signal to noise ratio and enhance statistical detection power in high-throughput RNAi screening experiments.

abstract = {Interactions between transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) and Wnt are crucial to many biological processes, although specific targets, rationale for divergent outcomes (differentiation versus block of epithelial proliferation versus epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) and precise mechanisms in many cases remain unknown. We investigated $\beta$-catenin-dependent and transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) interactions in pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in the context of EMT and pulmonary fibrosis. We previously demonstrated that ICG-001, a small molecule specific inhibitor of the $\beta$-catenin/CBP (but not $\beta$-catenin/p300) interaction, ameliorates and reverses pulmonary fibrosis and inhibits TGF-$\beta$1-mediated $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$-SMA) and collagen induction in AEC. We now demonstrate that TGF-$\beta$1 induces LEF/TCF TOPFLASH reporter activation and nuclear $\beta$-catenin accumulation, while LiCl augments TGF-$\beta$-induced $\alpha$-SMA expression, further confirming co-operation between $\beta$-catenin- and TGF-$\beta$-dependent signaling pathways. Inhibition and knockdown of Smad3, knockdown of $\beta$-catenin and overexpression of ICAT abrogated effects of TGF-$\beta$1 on $\alpha$-SMA transcription/expression, indicating a requirement for $\beta$-catenin in these Smad3-dependent effects. Following TGF-$\beta$ treatment, co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated direct interaction between endogenous Smad3 and $\beta$-catenin, while chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-re-ChIP identified spatial and temporal regulation of $\alpha$-SMA via complex formation among Smad3, $\beta$-catenin, and CBP. ICG-001 inhibited $\alpha$-SMA expression/transcription in response to TGF-$\beta$ as well as $\alpha$-SMA promoter occupancy by $\beta$-catenin and CBP, demonstrating a previously unknown requisite TGF-$\beta$1/$\beta$-catenin/CBP-mediated pro-EMT signaling pathway. Clinical relevance was shown by $\beta$-catenin/Smad3 co-localization and CBP expression in AEC of IPF patients. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to pulmonary fibrosis by specifically uncoupling CBP/catenin-dependent signaling downstream of TGF-$\beta$.},

abstract = {Mammalian cells can decode the concentration of extracellular transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) and transduce this cue into appropriate cell fate decisions. How variable TGF-$\beta$ ligand doses quantitatively control intracellular signaling dynamics and how continuous ligand doses are translated into discontinuous cellular fate decisions remain poorly understood. Using a combined experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we discovered that cells respond differently to continuous and pulsating TGF-$\beta$ stimulation. The TGF-$\beta$ pathway elicits a transient signaling response to a single pulse of TGF-$\beta$ stimulation, whereas it is capable of integrating repeated pulses of ligand stimulation at short time interval, resulting in sustained phospho-Smad2 and transcriptional responses. Additionally, the TGF-$\beta$ pathway displays different sensitivities to ligand doses at different time scales. While ligand-induced short-term Smad2 phosphorylation is graded, long-term Smad2 phosphorylation is switch-like to a small change in TGF-$\beta$ levels. Correspondingly, the short-term Smad7 gene expression is graded, while long-term PAI-1 gene expression is switch-like, as is the long-term growth inhibitory response. Our results suggest that long-term switch-like signaling responses in the TGF-$\beta$ pathway might be critical for cell fate determination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Investigation of dynamics and regulation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway is central to the understanding of complex cellular processes such as growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. In this study, we aim at using systems biology approach to provide dynamic analysis on this pathway.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We proposed a constraint-based modeling method to build a comprehensive mathematical model for the Smad dependent TGF-beta signaling pathway by fitting the experimental data and incorporating the qualitative constraints from the experimental analysis. The performance of the model generated by constraint-based modeling method is significantly improved compared to the model obtained by only fitting the quantitative data. The model agrees well with the experimental analysis of TGF-beta pathway, such as the time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad, the subcellular location of Smad and signal response of Smad phosphorylation to different doses of TGF-beta.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The simulation results indicate that the signal response to TGF-beta is regulated by the balance between clathrin dependent endocytosis and non-clathrin mediated endocytosis. This model is useful to be built upon as new precise experimental data are emerging. The constraint-based modeling method can also be applied to quantitative modeling of other signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Fundamental open questions in signal transduction remain concerning the sequence and distribution of molecular signaling events among individual cells. In this work, we have characterized the intercellular variability of transforming growth factor $\beta$-induced Smad interactions, providing essential information about TGF-$\beta$ signaling and its dependence on the density of cell populations and the cell cycle phase. By employing the recently developed in situ proximity ligation assay, we investigated the dynamics of interactions and modifications of Smad proteins and their partners under native and physiological conditions. We analyzed the kinetics of assembly of Smad complexes and the influence of cellular environment and relation to mitosis. We report rapid kinetics of formation of Smad complexes, including native Smad2-Smad3-Smad4 trimeric complexes, in a manner influenced by the rate of proteasomal degradation of these proteins, and we found a striking cell to cell variation of signaling complexes. The single-cell analysis of TGF-$\beta$ signaling in genetically unmodified cells revealed previously unknown aspects of regulation of this pathway, and it provided a basis for analysis of these signaling events to diagnose pathological perturbations in patient samples and to evaluate their susceptibility to drug treatment.},

abstract = {A fluorescence image calibration method is presented based on the use of standardized uniformly fluorescing reference layers. It is demonstrated to be effective for the correction of non-uniform imaging characteristics across the image (shading correction) as well as for relating fluorescence intensities between images taken with different microscopes or imaging conditions. The variation of the illumination intensity over the image can be determined on the basis of the uniform bleaching characteristics of the layers. This permits correction for the latter and makes bleach-rate-related imaging practical. The significant potential of these layers for calibration in quantitative fluorescence microscopy is illustrated with a series of applications. As the illumination and imaging properties of a microscope can be evaluated separately, the methods presented are also valuable for general microscope testing and characterization.},
