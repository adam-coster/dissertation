\chapter{On the insulation of morphogenic signaling}
\label{insulation:introduction}


Morphogenic signals are frequently found in apparent
gradients within developmental systems and stem cell
niches, and the set of concentrations of these
morphogens at a given point in space and time
is thought to provide the information
needed for cell fate specification
(see \ar{pathways:wntTgfb:gut}).
How cells integrate
the concentrations of distinct morphogenic signals is an
unsolved problem. Cells could integrate this information
during the process of signal transduction to the nucleus (e.g. by
direct protein-protein interactions between pathways),
after the transduced signals reach the nucleus (e.g. by
co-regulation of transcription targets), or at both of
these levels.


Importantly, as discussed in 
\ar{pathways:discussion}, integration at the level of
signal transduction (hereafter ``signaling'')
may lead to a decrease in nuclear
``knowledge'' of the original signals. Integration at
the level of transcription, however, can allow cells
to maintain a more accurate internal model of the
extracellular environment. Therefore, in order to
understand how cells make decisions in the context of
multiple extracellular information sources it is important
to identify the points at which pathway integration occurs.

The Wnt and \tgfbsf\ pathways provide highly-studied
systems for understanding how cells integrate
morphogenic signals.
As discussed in \ar{pathways:introduction}, the 
Transforming Growth Factor Beta superfamily (\tgfbsf) and
Wnt/\bcat\ (hereafter simply ``Wnt'') signaling
pathways are deeply conserved across metazoans,
are essential to development, and are disrupted
in many pathologies. These pathways are tightly
intertwined, frequently being used within the same
tissue compartments to coordinate cell fate decisions.
This coordination occurs despite an absence of shared core
pathway components, which suggests that it is primarily
mediated by long-term transcriptional interactions.
However, a number of studies have also identified
putative nodes of short-term signaling interaction
(see \ar{pathways:wntTgfb:mechanism} and
\ar{fig:pathways:xtalk}),
though the generality and importance of these
interactions remain unclear.


Wnt and TGFB are morphogenic:
their extracellular ligands lead to concentration-dependent
increases in downstream transcription factor activity.
Outside of this general similarity, the mechanisms by
which these pathways transduce their respective signals
are quite distinct. As reviewed in
\ar{pathways:tgfb}, \tgf\ and the related Bone Morphogenic
Protein (BMP) ligands cause their serine/threonine kinase
receptors to directly phosphorylate the target Smad
transcription factors, which subsequently increase in
nuclear abundance. Activation of the Wnt
pathway, on the other hand, blocks the otherwise
constitutive degradation of cytosolic \bcat,
thus leading to a whole-cell increase in the quantity
of this transcription factor
(reviewed in \ar{pathways:wnt}). The transduction of a
Wnt signal requires many protein components,
most of which have been implicated in direct
interactions with Smad proteins (\ar{pathways:wntTgfb:mechanism}).
Unfortunately, identification of interactions between
these pathways has so far led to contradictory and
context-dependent outcomes, suggesting that there is not
a general mechanism of \tgfbsf\ and Wnt signal integration.


However, as I explain in \ar{pathways:discussion},
it is possible that the methods used to study integration
of these pathways are simply incapable of identifying general
mechanisms of crosstalk. The majority of the crosstalk
studies (and even the studies of each pathway in isolation)
rely on overexpression or ablation of pathway components,
which may push cells into abnormal states and thus confound
interpretation of experimental results.
In this chapter, then, I take an endogenous and mechanism-independent
approach to directly test the extent
of signaling crosstalk between these pathways.


Signaling pathways
can interact in multiple ways during transduction. Without any
crosstalk, activation of one pathway will
by definition have no effect on the canonical output of another pathway
(\ar{fig:insulation:crosstalk}b).
With \b{non-additive} crosstalk, two pathways
may affect the same response but do so in an additive
manner (\ar{fig:insulation:crosstalk}c).
This would be the case, for example, with pathways that use
different pools of the same component.
Finally, pathways can interact
in more complex, non-additive ways in which the response
cannot be predicted by knowledge of one pathway alone
(\ar{fig:insulation:crosstalk}d).
Which of these crosstalk categories Wnt and \tgfbsf\ fall
into during signal transduction has not yet been uncovered.


I therefore designed an experimental approach that allows me to
distinguish between the three general classes of 
interaction described above. By measuring the direct
output of signaling for each pathway (i.e. transcription
factor nuclear concentration) as a consequence of
combinatorial \tgfbsf\ and Wnt ligand inputs, I can infer
both the class of crosstalk that the interactions fall into and
the quantitative extent of that crosstalk. Using
this approach, I show in \ar{insulation:wntTgfb} that Wnt and \tgfbsf,
in opposition to reports in the literature,
do not crosstalk at all during signal transduction.


Further, in \ar{insulation:bmpTgfb}
I show that \tgf\ is insulated from BMP signaling despite
sharing the core component Smad4. Intra-\tgfbsf\ inhibition is
widely thought to exist and to be due to competition
for limiting Smad4 (see \ar{pathways:tgfb:crosstalk}).
I find instead that neither of these claims are correct:
BMP4 and \tgf 3 do not inhibit one another even when Smad4 is brought
down to limiting levels.


Taken together, my results suggest then that cellular decision-making
with respect to TGFB and Wnt occurs primarily at
the level of transcription and not at the level of signaling,
thus allowing the cell to create a more accurate nuclear
model of the complex extracellular microenvironment
than would otherwise be possible.
